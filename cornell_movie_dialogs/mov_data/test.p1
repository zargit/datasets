I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Sure have.
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
But
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Did you change your hair?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Neat...
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
He was, like, a total babe
What if she never starts dating?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
What makes you think he'll do it?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Her favorite uncle
Assail your ears for one night.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What 're you talking about?
What's the worst?
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
You need money to take a girl out
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
How'd you do it?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
You and Verona?
He always look so
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William didn't even go to high school
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
You're not a big talker, are you?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
This is so patronizing.
Why?
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Kat! Wake up!
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Put your right foot there --
A soft side? Who knew?
What?
Is that a request or a command?
That ' s completely adorable!
Wait I...
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
As a parent, that's my right
Which parts?
Bianca did what?
Kat a fan, too?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
In the microwave.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I could be gone for years.
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
You defend yourself admirably...
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
How did you manage it?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Father Marchena!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
The ocean is uncrossable?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Now I become custody of police department?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
What was that, Korfin?
I'm gonna propose.
What's he looking for?
Are you hit?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Nah, I musta missed it.
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
You goin' to the escort service?
I'll let you know what happens.
Two heads.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Yeah.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Hey, honey.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay.
Ready?
And what do you do with the bones?
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
What?
Speak English!
How you erase this?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
I did.
Why not?
What is that?
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Yes, the money is good.
We started over, you can too.
Isn't he a little moody?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
I know.
Yes...he's my friend.
A cheap hotel.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
I'll send a cop back for you.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
How was it?
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
That's true
Five by five, Frank.
Yeah.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Bullshit.
Yeah.
Luther was part of the gang?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
Hey, you wanna bet?
There.
Where's the money?
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
That was quick.
Why?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
You okay?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah?
What the bell happened?
Which one pulled the trigger?
What a screw-up.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Billy Bear...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
No wonder you're so popular.
Hello.
Surprise, Luther.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
You want to go outside?
You sure?
What're you laughing about?
Who are you?
He's a she!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
What's she doing?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
At least, the cat comes back.
I don't need one.
...What's your name?
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Other than that... You all right?
Yeah?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
You hear that?
Love...
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Which one?
Apipoussan?
Here we go again...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
It's not?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Drink!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Welcome home.
Your clothing reeks of it.
I'm not accusing you...
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
What happened to you?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
What are these?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What are you talking about?
What's the problem?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
... sorry...
What the fuck are you.. ?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You're asking me why?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
You almost went over your limit.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
I'm not a cop.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You're learning.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
Pittsburgh?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Okay...
Hello... ?
You told me to look, so I looked.
How are you?  Having any luck?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
I didn't mean to...
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
What is this?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Kristen, what happened?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
You've been up all night?
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
How long have you been awake?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Enough of that crap.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
So?
Hey man, we're all sorry...
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Feeling better now?
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Is that who you're waiting for?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Mommy...?
Where is he?
But how...?
The tickets.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Alice!
What's that got to do with it?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
I've got to write some of this down.
Then get out!
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
I don't understand.
Vomit?
You, too?
You could train someone else.
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
We're stuck tight!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
You hear that?
Well?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Dave - !
Is there any way out of it?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
As we near the Pole...
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Well, I'll be - !
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Always has been.
I plan to. Soon.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
You heard the news.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
If you get it?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Safety on?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Sure you did.
Yeah. It's stupid.
I just think you used to be bad.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Are we going in this?
Pop?
How about a Big Mac?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
That's illegal, you know.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Something bugging you?
On what you pay me?
Want to buy?
You and Mel Gordon?
We should talk.
No problem. Look, I...
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
Money.
Alright. I'll think about it.
I know your parents.
What happened?
Coffee's perked.
What the hell are you talking about?
Who are you?
Something about my father?
Take care, Wade.
Marg!
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
You remember Margie Fogg?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Call it what you want.
Who?
Get some sleep.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Why?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
That's affirmative.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
*                     Please tell me your name.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Leave my daughter alone.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Finally, we can bargain.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Sir, we stay with the President.
You know what?
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
Where's my family?
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
You give me ulcers.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Oveur.
Elaine, what happened to us?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
You mean...
Now!
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
I guess this is a first for you.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, what's happening?!
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
No.  Poached.  Over.
You folks need any help?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Captain, how soon can we land?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
You got a telegram from headÂ­quarters today.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
But Ted, you're the only...
Airsick?
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
Roger.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
I like my horizons narrow.
You don't have squat.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Kill them both.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
What is wrong?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Who said that?
You know that guy?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
Your health...
I'm going home.
She's going to divorce me.
What was that about?
How potent?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah, I heard of it.
What kind of test?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
How can I go?
This floor's freezing.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Okay, let's do it.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Ripley...
Amy.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
Still nothing from the colony?
What is it?
I told them to fall back...
How do you feel?
What's the question?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
What's this?
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Yes.  A little girl.
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
Are we going to sleep now?
Look, I told you...
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
What?
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Hardly.
Now?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Why not?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Then he didn't send you?
Originals?
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
This is not his handwriting.
How much will you pay him?
Am I interrupting something?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
I see that you're expecting.
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Really?
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Sire.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Why so?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Would you tell me why?
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Why are you here?
Why not?
Papa, is this your idea?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Not that I've seen.
Is he working?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Leave that alone!
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
I'm afraid I am.
What for?
How could I not?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
You burned the score?
How fortunate.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Yes?
A Mass for the dead.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
How long will you give me?
You mean she's not coming back?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Where did I stop?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
It couldn't be simpler.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Do you want to rest a bit?
I am so ashamed.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
No, but I'm the best.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
What do you want?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
I can't say I do. What is it?
All Vienna has heard that.
Is it true?
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
No, you didn't!
But not his body.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
Herr Salieri.
Can we come in?
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
He's not?
No, why?
Could you get here without any trouble?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
It wasn't a lunatic.
Mr. Kessler?
Call me David.
Do you like it?
How old are you?
How old are you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
What?
I'm a werewolf.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
How are we feeling tonight?
I think he's a Jew.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Some, everyone does.
You're in a hospital in London.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Well, I like it here.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Hello.
Jack, we'd better go.
What the hell was that all about?
Beware the moon?
Say, David...
It's moving.
It's in front of us.
It sounds far away.
Nice to see you.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
What are you doing here?
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
What can I say, Jack?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
I could hang myself.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
What can we do to assist you?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
What's that?
Hot chocolate?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Oscar, what's the matter?
He has?
Yeah.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
That don't do us any good.
know, butÂ
Ârunning around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Well, what?
Why are you so anxious?
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Why, Matt!
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Much better this morning, thank you.
Excuse meÂ
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Oh!
Yes?
Helen!
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Well, IÂ
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Absolutely.
No.
Yes.
No.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
What did you find out, Mike?
Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with itÂ
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
Then who changed it?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
How'd they --
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Damn!
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
How?
Not now.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
I got seven thousand.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
What are you saying?
Fine. We hit this bank.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
I think one of 'em's glass.
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Then why can't I go in there?
Boys...
Daddy, don't start with this again.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
She's still talking to Jesus.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Easterners.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Zee.
I beg your pardon?
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
We're moving you tomorrow.
You almost ended my career before it began.
That's what I would have done.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
You okay, Jesse?
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
There's only four of them...
Just perfect.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
You wouldn't have done that?
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
I know. Stop it.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
This is Dorsia?
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Why?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
We should do it.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
He's rich.
You're inhuman.
Where are you going?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Oh, something. . romantic?
I'll do it.
What is it?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Want a bite?
Interesting.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
She's my...cousin.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
So...you hang out here a lot?
I mean they want to get caught.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
No hash browns?
I've questioned him.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
I lost my job...
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
...What?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Milo?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
You're living here?
What?!
Is it your software?
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I heard what happened.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Did you?
You've been coming in early.
I'm okay. It's going well!
That's great! Thanks.
You could've handwritten it.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Longitude 109 --
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
What've you got there?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
...Milo?
Who can we trust?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I don't know --
Why were you snooping in my office?
Meet me at the other location.
...He knows.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Who're these guys?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Hello, Exposition.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
What's wrong with your hand?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Why?
I can't. You're drunk.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Who?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
I'll hurry back.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Danger Powers, personal effects.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Commander, I have to log it...
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Quite impressive.
What is it now?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Hi.
An evil vet?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
In due time.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
What did you say?
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't label people here, Scott.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Hope...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Would that I could say the Same.
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
Then you can't come in.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
How curious ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
My father always wanted a boy.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
But why? What's the point?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
But
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Was I?
To kill me?
Because you always obey orders ...
And do you trust me?
But you did suspect me.
You're playing games.
I thought you played by the rules.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
What's that you're wearing?
Trubshaw again? What now?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Steed
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Are you alright, young man?
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
The last one you'll ever see.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
What's happening?
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
What?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I've decided not to run for President.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Nice shot.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
God, you're a slob.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
A strange wang right in my palm.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Really?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's on the tenth floor.
Oops!
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
What's the matter?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Under the table!
Rick, I'm concerned.
Debbie.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You're late again, Rick.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
You gotta let me finish --
-- He killed people --
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Thanks.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Ready?
...Not now, Brian.
Hey, what are you doing here?
It's okay, Stephen, I --
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Brian.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
With grenadine, right?
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Hey.
You think that's really any of your business?
Okay.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Hi.
What'll you do?
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Who the fuck is doing this?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Where are you going?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Did you pull me out?
Did I say thanks?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Yeah. Big fan.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Completely out of control.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
What?
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Fireman shit?
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
I'm working on it.
You don't know... nobody knows...
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
People.
Yeah.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Let's go niggers!
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Yeah, him.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
Please, have a seat.
I'm out.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
Nice to meet you.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
My tap shoes.
What do I have to do?
I would like to change your name.
You're now Mantan.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
I'm feelin' dis'!
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
That's what I'm askin'.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
I love you too, Daddy.
So what's up with you?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
You lost me.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
You've said that already.
Your life will never be the same.
Same here.
What is this?
For what?
Thanks.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
This is crazy.
Yes, your name?
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
How did you get this gig?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I never had a really real pair before.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
To come back to our roots.
...aconite get it dat cheap.
I slept too near where I fell out.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
So what's up with you?
The good stuff.
What else?
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
Why don't you call him?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Have you taken my message to him?
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious!  What is this?
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Who else can give me information about you?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
How so?
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible?
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
May I be quite frank with you?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Papa?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Did -- did you --
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
You killed him you fucking faggot --
Yeah, right...
You did Basic here?
There's no need...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I apologize --
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Where's the cabin?
What the fuck is going on?
So you killed him?
What do you mean, West's?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
I... I don't know...
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Dunbar will testify that you were.
How do you know?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
That bad?
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
Hostile and uncooperative.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Move him.
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
What is that?
Something wrong?
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
You wanted to break him.
Think it'll work?
No bodies, no West...
What?
What are you doing out here?
I was freezing from the hurricane --
We just want --
No one else heard it?
But you didn't see it, right?
Pike never confessed.
Who, Levi --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
See! The big guy likes it.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
Or are you too scared?
Bloom!
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
How would you describe him?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
How old are you?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
In so many words, yes.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
I'll...
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Jesus Christ.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Son?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
Oh.
You don't even know me.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm going with you.
Do you love your father?
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
I need you on my side.
How is he?
How much time does he have left?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
That really happened?
Is he awake?
Mom?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
So you never bought any land.
You first.
Say thank you.
What? What are you doing?
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
I need to know who you are first please.
Yes. I know.
Right.
No.
You must have a visa or something...
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Today is bath day.
I don't understand.
"Frenzy".
In the world.
What?
No.
We'll pretend it never happened.
Sometimes which?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I don't know.
Something else.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Goodbye.
It's not mine.
Why?
It's a long way to go for a date.
You have excellent English.
What are you doing?
Angela?
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
I bet you have loyal customers.
Hey.
What do you need?
More cough syrup?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
For your hands?
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Better?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
I keep the heat on.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
YOU SHUT UP!
Don't... don't say that to me...
Let me say somethin' first...
How you let men treat ya like they do?
You some kind'a pervert?
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
You take it straight?
Where you gonna be?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
He tapped that.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
Why's his britches round his knees?
You get a call from Rose?
Goin' dove huntin'?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Keep the change on that.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
You a preacher?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I'm a what?
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Back-up.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Squid?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
All right, how's the new partner?
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
She disappeared... shit!
I'm not drunk...
Where does this Sugai live?
I want to go talk to him.
It's very small.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.
Someone attacked him.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
She ever pull down her shades?
And I'm supposed to care?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Might be different in New York.
Dope?
One guy do all the damage?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
We're police officers.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
If I say no?
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
What's the point?
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Show me something?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
I was just about to have my dinner.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
You start.
How do I stop one?
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Number three.
I think I have no money.
Thank you very much.
Those cockroaches?
How long you had these guys?
Prosit.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
You're going to be over the limit.
Why didn't you go?
Book the good ones for where?
What shows?
Yeah?
It that mother real?
Are you apprehensive?
I've already got more help than I need.
Do I make you nervous?
I can imagine.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
I told you I'd come back.
Do you dream?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
But then how can you...
Ten years.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Bad?
She didn't know?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
How come you were in my truck?
What about friends?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
This is my new friend...
You're kidding!
Well, that depends...
How do you do?
No, I'm lost.
I came on a bus.
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Nope.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
...Okay.
Two weeks.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Yes.
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
When do you need her by?
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
The what?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I like her.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Adam?!
What?
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Are you all right?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
How do I leave here?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
That's what everybody believes?
You have very nice ceilings.
I love Lucy!
Right on the button.
What's the capitol?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
No.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
The recovery is very impressive.
Why did you park way back there?
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
Bye, Troy!
The hotel.
Twenty-five? Around there.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
We have to go.
Well, where are you --
He drank it hot?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
It's time.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Thirty -five years!
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Oh, no.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Why?
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
You came back for these?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Give me your hand.
Alright, I will.
Well, what do you think?
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Where are you going?
To bed?
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What?!!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What's wrong?
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Tower, say again!!
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Sure I'm alright. 
Thank you. honey.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who is Don?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
No. I should go.
Yes. Frank--
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
I love you Don with all my heart.
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
Hello, baby.
Hello, daddy.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hello?
No thanks.
On a ride.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Hey? You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What?
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I've gotta go in.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Okay, yeah, call.
Okay, thanks.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
You want to tell me about it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey!!
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
What was that all about?
It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Probably not. No. Why?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Hey, I just...
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Anybody you think is evil?
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
What the fuck are you doing?
Look again for fuck sake!
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Nine bodies.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Now, you will receive us.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
She was in here when it went down.
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh my god!
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Hello?
You bet your ass he will.
You're right.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Just be natural, goddamit.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Making Hutch David Soul?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Why?
This is he?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Where are you going?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Is that the manager?
What about what that guy said?
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Inez, this is --
Which one was that?
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Our money situation is not good.
I had to give some to Inez.
That's what she is!
What time did he say to be here?
He doesn't want to fight.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. As a girl.
You're all clear.
Uh-huh?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Help me move him.
What are you talking about?
Like amnesia.
Where?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
That was a test?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
We're renegades from despair.
See you.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
You think he got my license plates?
How long are they going to hold him?
Anthony, I --
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Was Future Man adopted?
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Were you born in Mexico?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
You stole a Trans-Am.
OK, Bob.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
The weed.
What do you mean get back?
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
Is he breathing?
Do they let you --
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
He said you ran away from home.
How long do you have to go?
Is he good?
Why?
You a good pool player.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
Treadstone.
And what are we looking for?
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
Excuse me.
May I finish?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Why not? It was just money.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Who else knows about this?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
Because you're afraid!
Who sent you to Greece?
Pamela Landy?
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
Switch! You drive!
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I love you, too.
I did.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
You hear me? I believed you.
A Russian?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Abbott?
Where am I?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
You didn't answer my question.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
You're sure?
This is everything? Is there.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
So he fooled you.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
What are they doing?
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
When will his trial be?
I'll wait... back there.
Stephen ready?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
You know it's a trap.
That's just a dream, William!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
I have faced him. Have you?
Treason. Against whom?
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Tonight then.
I need you so much! I love you!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Peace is made is such ways.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Why? What for?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
You know the answer to that.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Please, mom. People will talk.
Why do you ask?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Just. Like. Jason.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
I deserve a lot worse.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Not since we were kids.
So how's Tommy?
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Where... where are my clothes?
Why are you doing all this for me?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I don't get it.
And...?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
And you are...?
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Look what you made me do!
Just get out, didja?
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Lenny? Come on!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Goodnight.
You haven't heard my offer.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Rick?
Not an easy day to forget.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
Yes, of course, we --
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Please.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
For the last time, put them on the table.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
It's been a long time.
When will he be back?
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
This time they really mean to stop me.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Ilsa, I --
No, Victor, there isn't.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Be careful.
Rick? Who's he?
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Well, this might come in handy.
No. It's all arranged.
Everything in order?
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I believe you have a message for him?
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
I was misinformed.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Is that a serious offer?
He is traveling with a lady.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, it's my party.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
You're late.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Uh huh.
Where were you last night?
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
You ever going to bed?
Boss, let's get out of here.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
It's bad.
Get up.
Get water!
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
It's real.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
Yeah, a long one.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Four four.  A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
I have to.
That's your dog.
That about sums it up.
Come on.  Try.
What will you do?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
You're Chuck Noland.
Thought you were going to bring her.
What happened to your pants?
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Kamal is not here.
How'd it go?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
Forget it.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
I beat the odds!
Cool ropes.
You were how long on this?
Digital laser readers.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
What's she so emotional about?
How many months are you?
I know.
Where's Mandalay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Please don't make me say it again.
"...did." Well, okay.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Is *your* father dead?
But did you know him?
What's an immigrant?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
They're migrants.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
What's that? What's it called?
It looks like scurvy.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Where's the name sheet?
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
I am not a doctor.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Rose Rose?
What's that?
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Then it's malaria?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
Rose Rose has runned away!
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Can --
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
What's this?
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
The Anti-Christ?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
I can see why you liked her.
But there were other factors.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
You're a superstitious fucker.
She had you tempting fate.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Whoa. What?
I'm going home
It can buy you a new and better you.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
You'll be there?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Listen, Scooter --
Excuse me?
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Come here. Feel this.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Attractive girl.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
What -- What do we do?
What about... The money?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
What the hell's his problem?
I don't trust anyone.
You told me to change my hair!
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Do you have something to prove?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
How do you deal with --
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
You got my cell. Leave a message.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
And we got rid of the red head.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Pretty much.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
So what do you want?
Just a tip.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
It's just insurance.
What are you doing?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
I got scared.
How about fifteen hundred?
What?!
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
How's that football story corning along?
How did it go?
I loved it blond.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
That girl, she works at the casino --
What?
How did you know I was here?
What?
No.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
What happened?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I'm in trouble.
They mean it.
The point is, they want a man inside.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Is it yes?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
And your hand too.
Jani! Where are you?
How are you?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
Why four? And not three or five?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Girlfriend?
You can start Monday week.
What's he doin'?
It didn't go off.
What the hell?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Armed.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
What are you gonna name it?
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
We're running out of time, sir.
Men... men... what happened, men?
Oh, yeah?
No wire.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
I'll make it worth your while.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
You're a thief?
Thank God.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Bent.
How do I know you didn't?
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
Know where I can find her?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
Yeah.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Please...
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Not right now.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
She's got my word.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Right, the big one-oh.
Hey, Sketchy--
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Really?
Does this person have a name?
And why should she?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She was the one--
True, but--
Okay, okay, okay--
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
What about this?
Thanks, miss.
What the hell is that?
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Pick a song, Hawk.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Sorry.
Beth? I can't believe it.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Whoa... she just farted.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
I found the Volvo.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
What?!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
No.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
I did it! I did it! We won!
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
But we took the keys?
Look, you can have my wallet...
I don't even think you have a gun!
Are you AFRAID?
What happened?
Dr. Monnitoff?
Like a DeLorean.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Dea ex machina...
Where did you come from?
How much longer is this gonna last?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Don't look so freaked.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
You're weird.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
Donnie?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Well...
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
What? How long was I asleep?
Will you please talk to me?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Come with me.
Is that a cellar door?
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Grandma Death.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Oh, shit!
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Where are you going?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
So, I met a new friend.
His name is Frank.
I think he saved my life.
Don't you watch the news?
What about your family, Donnie?
How does that make you feel?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Nothing.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
What's her name?
Why would I tell Mom?
Gerald.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
If that's what you think is necessary.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
How did this happen?
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Wicked.
Where is she?!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
What is wrong with you?
I gotta work with these women.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Mom!
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
What're you doin' here?
What?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
And the bite marks on my ears?
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
Dakota.
That bitch from...
The bitch.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Lester?
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
That's enough!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
What!
This is -- what?
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
And wear a crown and everything.
Who to?
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
Father...
Yes -- why?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
No, but I shot some ducks.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Why wasn't I insulted?
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
How'm I doing, boss?
It must be done right away.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Are you sure you're not tired?
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
What'll I do with this card?
Your Excellency!
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Did it go well, darling?
John loves the house.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
I want my man back.
Never mind that, I want my man!
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Good! How is the patient?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
You never mentioned his mental state.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Tell me about it, please!
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
How awful for John.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
You alright?
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
...Yyes
Merrick...
Mmmerrick.
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
...Yes potatoes... but...
Ohhh...
Good morning, John.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
Is it the one you wanted?
The workhouse.
Won't come out, eh?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
It's your fantasy...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
Please! Please! What are those?
What's the matter?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
No!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
The second note.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But you don't want to hear it.
No.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
How deep IS the ocean?
That's terrible!
Halfdan the Black's here!
What?
I... I... KILLED her...
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
Look, the sky is blue...
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
You'll be sucked down too!
There is another way.
What's the matter with them?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
It can't do you any HARM...
Same thing, isn't it?
Are you all right?
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Who's that?
What?
Get away, Snorri.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Help!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did my father and his father before him.
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well, of course he is!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
Yeah.
May I help you?
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
Come over after I'm done here?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Really? Because --
I can't remember.
I don't really know how --
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
I'm sure you would.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
It's okay.
I'm not a stalker.
Yeah.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Take care.
You like that?
Frost?
You just say. I'm not really --
Well, I should probably get going.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
How can you watch this crap?
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
Oh?
There's this guy!
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
I scoured the city for it.
Probably.
You know what I did.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
I knew.
What if you stay this time?
Bye, Joel.
When?
Listen, did you want to make love?
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
That's me.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Clementine.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
So what's going on, Joel?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
I'm sorry.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
It's just... y'know... I mean...
See you later, alligator.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yup.
I don't know! I just said that!
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
And after that?
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
What's this?
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Okay, we're back in.
What, Howard?
You made me have an abortion.
Stan? What's going on?
Mary. What are you doing here?
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Does that help?
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Where are the others?
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
You're political, then?
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. NiwetĂźkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
That's Jellybean!
Extraordinary!
What do you think?
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Why? Why do you have to go?
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
Ballast.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
From what?
Will it work?
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
You weren't there. I saw it.
Is that an offer?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
Do you hear it? Right there.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
What's the hold up?
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Jesus its huge.
Peters is right, no one's here.
I can see the hatch.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Yes.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
Explanation?
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
Where has it been for the past seven years?
Your eyes...
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
Heading three-three-four...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Now what?
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
First time in a grav couch?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
No. I saw nothing.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
You can't do that.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
What is it?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
How'd you know it was me?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Where... where am I?
Reed?... Sue?
Hey! That's a prototype!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
What are you doing --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
What?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
What are you doing?
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Come on, Ben, come on...
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Is everything okay at work?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Are you still a virgin?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Leave me alone!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
You're a really good kisser.
Hey, Mike?
It's definitely your mama.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Are you Linda Barrett?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
How long does Doug take?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
What do you think it is?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I want romance.
Sometime?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
I couldn't make it in time.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
What's that?
What can I get for you tonight.
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
What's your other question?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
No. That's okay.
I don't know.
...I've got to go home.
Where's Mike today?
I made a fool of myself.
What about the notes?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Let's have lunch!
Killed?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
What happened? What did they do to her?
What do you mean by that?
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
...and we're chock full of that!
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
That's what gives me The Fear.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
I want that fucking radio!
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Lucy.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
This is a fucking nightmare.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
What is this?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
So do we, lady.
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
You'd pay me for that?
You realize...
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
In that case, maybe she can help.
What?
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
I will not die because of him!
We should go! We should go right now!
I don't think you should...
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
We shot a skunk.
We'll be food, dickheads!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
We're going to get help.
We gotta be close.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
Oh, no.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
What? Really?
My husband...
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What's going on between you two?
Open?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I'll go with ya.
Welcome back.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
SHIT.
Yeah, maybe.
Well, maybe they migrate?
DON'T!
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Let's go!
Get to your cars!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Her name is Charlie.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
We should stick together out there.
Did we make it?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Frances?  Oh no.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Oh. I mean, good.
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
You're afraid!
Okay, but come here first.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
What's up?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
Without me.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
What do I do, Dad?
Of course.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Francie, you know I can't do that.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
See you next weekend?
Oh, Kurt!
Name?
What?
Just one minute...
Whattaya mean?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Frances...
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
You're telling me.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Oh my God, I look awful.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
To quarter-horses.
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
I think I need a little air.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Normal. Average.
This whole thing is a joke!
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Why... her?
This was not taken from a grave.
She's beautiful.
Nothing. Still nothing.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
God took her from us.
Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Brother and sister still?
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
Victor!
No. But someday.
I am not mad.
Henry Clerval.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
They just caught the man who did it.
You can't. Death is God's will!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
For what?
Philosophical?
What is your name?
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Preposterous.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Re-configure the leads?
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Ah. An explorer.
I heard.
Your men are right to be afraid.
What'd you see?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
You draw very well.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Alice? The others show up?
Oh, my God...
Filmmaker.
What'll you do when you leave here?
You can only do what you can do.
Where?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
You know what I said, though.
You saved my life.
What hath God wrought?
Ha!
Are you wet?
Best over...
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
You okay?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
You like the car?
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
What about Kate?
You don't believe in suicide.
Why did they block the door again?
She's dead?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Who else?
What did you call me?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
It's the bitterest of pills.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
Not good enough, swear to God.
I'm going for 'em!
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yeah.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- see this, television!
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Not even for lunch?
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
I never said help us!
What the fuck was that about?
Start the car.
Do they have cable?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Richard!
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
How?
My shit is together.
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
The woman I saw you with...
Who's...  Lieuten --
Wow...
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
None at this time, sir.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Oh, really.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
No, sir, WHAT?
See me, sir?
Permission to leave, sir?
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Think I overplayed it?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Can't complain, ma'am.
You don't know that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
O'Neil?
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
That bad?
So why are you telling me this?
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Which is guy-speak for...
They're more afraid of you.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Last time I didn't.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Do you, uh, know...
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
She part of the training?
Say again, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
O'Neil...
I just wonder how that happened.
We're fucked.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
What?
Me!? You where the one...
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
My God. He's going after the nest.
What are you doing?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Circuits are overloaded.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Did you talk with Humphries?
I can't.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
That is our job.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Somebody must have seen it.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
What'd they say?
I understand.
"The show must go on."
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
God, what an ass.
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
What?  What?
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
He's a miserable twit!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
He always has to make the big entrance.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Systems register functional.
U.... What do you think?
... What does that mean?
No, I'll kill you. .
It's suicide.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Where are the miners?
I am SO SICK of being right.
Your last name.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
~e're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
It's Jason...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Excuse me?
Where?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Hold course, Laredo!
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Over three hundred miles.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Is that a fact.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
I hope I never have to believe that.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Misunderstood what!?
Who is that!?
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
I'm so inclined.
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Yessir.
They are... friends of Congress.
The British army, sir!
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
Like flowers after the snow melts.
Surely you knew this was coming.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
But, you do come from a military family?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
I say!
You hear that?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
Where is my nephew?
He's around someplace.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
She's... young.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You're an investor, is that it?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
I'm looking at you.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Keep going.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -Â this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer Â-
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
For a movie?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
We talk different?
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
What's that?
Whatta you think, Chill?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
The door from the patio, in back.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
You been here the whole time?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Why not?
I told you not to -Â
Whatta you doing out there?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
What a spectacular view.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Oh, for Christ's sake Â-
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
What day is it?
Maureen.
Roger.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
How much longer's that gonna take?
But how long?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long?
Went aboard.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Sounds like the hull.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I think you know.
The radio!
What?!
What the hell happened!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
What's slow?
Morning everybody.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
What'd he look like?
You okay?
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Who?
What guy?
You sure it wasn't me?
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Epps? You there?
Over the gold.
Greer to Murphy.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Call the Coastguard?
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
Morning.
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
What now?
Say what?
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
I thought you say Tuesday.
What's this?
That cost me twenty grand at least.
You're kidding, right?
Give up?
Maxine.
Yup.
Are you still looking for a job?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
What are you trying to say?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
Forget it.
Hi Josh.
Hi... what's up?
What do you mean "why"?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
I might actually get the pasta special.
Does Oomie really like this show?
What does it stand for?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Do you think he knows?
He's insane!
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
That was truly pathetic.
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Just promise you'll do it.
What? How long have you been standing there?
It's a surprise.
You won't believe it! Guess!
Anthony's II!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
You're gross.  See that guy?
He gives me a total boner!
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
How repulsive!
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
We're not.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
May I ask what you're doing?
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, how "punk."
Hi... what's your name?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
I'm totally serious!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
I don't think so...
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
So, why did you bring this along?
What did you tell that girl?
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
Wow, this is so cool...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Boo!
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Just someone so young...
In what way do you mean?
...What do you mean?
What are you doing here?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
What about Joe?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Yeah, well... me neither...
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
What do we have here, Margaret?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Thank you, doctor.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Starting now, we attack them.
You've never built in Africa.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
I do need to see Starling.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Think about something else.
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
I'll be bait alone?
The workers don't get on?
I am also liaison between these two.
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Where is it?
Why so many?
Where do you go next?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Oh no.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
You're really good, you know.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I'm not even good for me.
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Sorry!
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
Well, good night, Louis.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
Egon!
What now, Brainiac?
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
From where -- Neptune?
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Like a goat on garbage.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
Ready?
Does it have any favorites?
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Are you telling me how to drive?
Aren't you glad we waited?
Now where are you going?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
That's too bad.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I think I should spend the night here.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Do you want this body?
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Did you see it?  What was it?
I want you to have this. 
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Great!  How's it going?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
All right.  What is it?
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
What happened??!!!?
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
That's what you told me two days ago!
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
Those are priceless sculptures.
What is that... wailing?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Yes, Caesar?
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Where are they?
Servis made it through again?
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
What the hell was all that about?
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
You need to come home!
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Aren't you eating?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Where is the car?
But could you try?
Was she married or something?
Did they ever find out?
Okay.
I do.
Why aren't you ready?
Elaine --
Let me go.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Why wouldn't it?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
Why do you have to see him?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
Benjamin?
657-2036
Ben.
Yes, I will.
What are you then?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
I'm putting it here by the door.
I'd rather not.
Where are you?
What?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Is it a girl?
Will you take me home?
You don't?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
All right then.
No.
Oh my God.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Her portrait?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Won't you unzip my dress?
Thank you.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
May I sit down?
He didn't see me.
Yes.
Why don't you get it.
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
That you're afraid --
Anything. Anything at all.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Good.
I have my reasons.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Did I say that?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
What are you doing?
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I do.
You believe me, don't you?
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Say that again.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Thank you very much, sir.
What?
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Now look -- please --
Hello.
Can you see me now?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
I don't believe it.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
And what are you going to do?
How?
Never?
Reducing?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
We'll dance.
I'll do anything for you.
Going?
Yes -- tired...
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
There.
And now?
You do believe that I really love you?
Very early in the morning.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
I can't.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Thank you, sir.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Then you know him?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Ready, Kringelein?
Well -- last night was not so good.
And the child isn't coming?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Oh!
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
You like music?
Really?
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Yes, of course, -- money!
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Am I!
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
What brown hands you have.
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Miss Flaemm.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Baron!
You're sweet.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
What?
I mean with the Manchester people?
No water -- What a place!
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Yes --
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
I can't dance tonight --
Let us cancel the engagement.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Madam should sleep.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
Yes, the police must be called.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
No. No word.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
What do you want with her?
Hi, Bobo.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
You're calling the shots.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Not much time.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
Why?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Just a few bucks.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
I didn't teach you that.
I can't. I just left home.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Look at me.
Roy? It this all we have?
Get well soon.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
Working the what?
I've heard the name.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
He retired.
Upstate.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
That's what I say.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Roy Dillon?
That's natural.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Ate the gun. Oh.
Oh, Jesus.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Carter.
That's it?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Yes.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
No shit?!
No.  Wait for the police.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
What the --
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
It's an option.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
You really think Eddie killed her?
Still wants to move out?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
The serial killer?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
You aced it, didn't you?
Shane's going as a condom.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
What should I do?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
What is that?
There you are.  Who was that boy?
Where's the child?
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
You've created a monster.
Yes?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Hm?
Home is important to a man.
No.
Home.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
I didn't tell you everything.
You know what gets me?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I'm liable to find anything!
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Go to the funeral?
Hi, Penelope.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
You never played a violin.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What an awful sound!
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Man and boy.
College!
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're supposed to get hurt!
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Can I get dressed first?
Dad--
I'm a man.
What's this?
Gee whiz, Dad--
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Some kind of animal?
Disease?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Now that's what I call fun.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
I have some change!
Breakfast?
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Tell me about its sexual roots.
Go on.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I came for my clothes.
A dozen?
Did you like it, dear?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Help your mother find the bullet.
Ooops.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
You've been bitten by bats?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
It died for your sins.
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
Hands and knees, you say?
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
Don Quixote.
Here.  Finish the job.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
I'm going to shoot you now.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
New lives begin!
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Dead!
What happened?
I'm only ten years old.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Because he was cruel?
That goes double for me.
Thank you, kind sir.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
A lot of people don't.
What does he say to do?
Really?
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I'm touched.
I see.
Did you talk to Paul?
I'm sorry.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
You were wonderful.
It's true.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
This is very good for us.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
I wish Paul luck.
They didn't murder me.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
That's been said before.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
No. I don't think so.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
What do you mean?
I'm getting angry.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Just one.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Are you Niki?
Nah.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Of Joanne's?
Say what?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
What's T-J?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
They are the same.
Granville?
Andy.
Mast?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Yeah. Probably.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
What happened, pilgrim?
Is Marsha there?
Wes, do me a favor.
I don't know.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Take it or leave it.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
Fifty cents admission.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
Not exactly...
Hold it, mister.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
You can fuck off, too.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
And what are you studying?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Took it?
Haven't we met before?
We planted it.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Because if you are...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
What do you want?
What do you see?
Yes.
But this is my car.
All right.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
No. 
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Why do you say that?
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
What?
Oh, my. We're too late.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
What were you fighting for?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
He's stopped.
The ice is melting.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Maude, I must speak to you.
But they'll put me in jail.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Don't you advance on me.
How about some candy floss?
Look at the stars.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
"And this too shall pass away."
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
And why is that?
Just give me a rough estimate.
Fifteen.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
What would you say?
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
That's right.
The moment of truth.
Yes.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Yes.
It's different for us.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Frank.
She's done it.
It's coming.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
And you're sure it was a woman?
Get out of the way.
I've got to finish it.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
Who's the squirt?
Well, you did break out --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
She's dead.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Thank you.
You're kidding --
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
You want me to hold him down?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Anything else you --
You better have that looked at.
Goodnight, then.
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Pardon?
You fucking ass-holes.
Will you sign for the bed?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Got her mother's looks.
Oh.
No time for argument.
Many times.
Nobody escapes us.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
Julia!
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
No.
Bastard.
You're Julia, right?
I'm brother Frank.
Back from where?
...somebody...
I'm hurting
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
A long time.
This is what began it.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Kirsty? It's very late.
What's the problem?
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
Why didn't he want to sell it?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
Larry!
Where are you?
Is it deep?
You're NOT going to faint.
Take it slowly.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Julia?
I'll be down in a minute
Larry...
I suppose that's right.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Is this your place ?
Who brought me in here?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Kirsty.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Need any help?
Not that late.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I'll come back later, huh?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Play it.
We'll do it next Monday.
I wanna date a musician...
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
My band.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
That's what I said.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Anna.
Anna Moss.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Hey, Barry.
Where's Rob?
Is that it?
Yeah.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
'Morning, Dick.
No, that's okay.  Really.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
Rob.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
-- Alright, alright but --
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
But don't you remember?
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Did you say something?
I suppose so.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Yeah.  Great.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You know I'm a good person.
Sure they are.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Do you want me to be there?
What do you want to do?
Look, we can do other things.
What about Ian?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
How?  How were we the same people?
But what?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
What are you going to talk to me about?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
What's happenin'.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
You haven't even seen it!
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
She left.  She's gone.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
But you must have --
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
How old is Richard?
Happy birthday.
He was unsual.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
No.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Do you play?
Grave robbers?
Who?
He tried to kill me last night.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
Maybe it would do us both good.
You're using your son's name.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I'm not even sure why.
Not the same.
There are differences.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it you want?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
I want Taupin.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Aye.
It is the truth.
How can I stop such a man?
Why?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
No doubt.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Do not turn your back on me.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Yeah.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
The last four.
How did you find me?
I haven't drunk this much since-
I knew his great-grandfather.
You've been here from the start.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
What were _you_ looking for?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
My condolences.
Home.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
Oh, it isn't like that.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right, dear.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Mr. Burns --
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
How's business, Bruce?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
How long would the interview take?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
Call Duffy!
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Done what?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
You can break it, can't you?
Sure you can. Come on.
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
What now?
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Now you're talking!
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
She jumped out of the window.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Hildy!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Don't open that!
No!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Hildy!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
What!
It'll be Heaven!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Who do you want?
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Sure, boss.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Boy, did you see her go?
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
I'll call.
Take your paws off me!
He's harmless.
What went off?
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Shoot to kill, I said.
Who is this man?
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
Look out, you --
Have you got my dough?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Kings and sixes.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Hiding him where?
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
How'd you get here, Earl?
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Who? Me?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
For heaven's sake, why not?
Pinkus.
Get out of here!
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
What's your hurry?
Baldwin -- his name is.
What's that?
That was a googly!
This is going too far, young man.
It's true.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
You want to join our gang?
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
You couldn't.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
What is it?
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What about it?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
And what's that?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
What are you going to be then?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
He always knows.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
What is it, pet?
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Is it peace in out time?
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
I wish it could all have been different.
You're having me on, Molly.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
I agree.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Drink up, it's party time.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
He left!
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Thank you.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
That's not something to joke about.
I'd like to see that.
What?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
What's this?
The Duke?
You mean John Wayne?
She's pretty cute.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Really fucking awesome.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
She looks like she stinks.
What's he so excited about?
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Hey, he moved.
Drive through it!
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
How's about you give me those same directions.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah?
So what?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Thank you.
What are you laughing at?
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Recover any bodies?
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Just back up.
I'll go. It's my fault.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
This is way too fucked up for words.
Where's Bill?
Well hello, officer.
What should I do?
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
We gotta break it open.
Mr. Willis?
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
You remind me so much of Nathan.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
I am sleepy.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
My brother says he likes you, too.
No. I married a midget.
Oh?
Be still my crotch.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
I'll be in touch.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
What are you doing in there?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Oh, and the sun block?
Did you see that?
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Come on.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Who is it?
Who is it?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
How's work?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Bravo to you, Puff!
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Ugnh.
Puff, put the gun down.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
No, why?
Pittsburgh?
Huh?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
I'm ready.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
I want to talk to you.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
I'll make it up to you.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
That's your problem.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Hello, Eddie.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Sign up.
What's that supposed to mean?
So does Eddie.
How do we stand?
When do I raise the bet?
I'll beat him the next game.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
He's my partner.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Why?
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Go to hell.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Oh yeah? Where?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
When?
That's right. When?
What time?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Who's he?
What's the limit?
You quittin', friend?
Long wait for a bus?
How long have you been waiting?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
Hey!
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I could always get us a bottle.
Fifth of scotch?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You got it all in your head?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
I'm hungry.
What are you writing?
What happened?
You glad?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Is that a fact?
I hear you've been looking for me.
Very good shot.
You name it.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
You want to find them.
Why don't you start with me?
What choice did I have -- ?!
I only protect myself -- !
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
I don't know.
Emma...
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
I surrender --
So, what do you do?
Bathroom?
What's that, Dad?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
There are more this year than last.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
Do you know how to follow a map?
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
I have school.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
You're being paranoid.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
What do you want me to do?
Love was never our problem.
You saved a lot of lives.
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
You still got the Olds?
Not listed, huh?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Dad, please...
Nice meeting you.
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
How're we doing?
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
It's doing what?
Be careful.
Really? You don't mind?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Your son.
Really? Ballet?
I shouldn't have left her.
Stop it.
I don't need it.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
They let you out?
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I'm not leaving.
What the hell's going on?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Call them back.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Yes.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Yes. Now we know.
What about you?
Henry, the pen --
Are you expected?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
Where did this come from?
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Don't wander off.
My room!
At least I let you tag along.
What do you know about this place?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
All I have to do is squeeze.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
It is you Junior!
You did!!
I ought to tell you something.
Dad!
Dad!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Stop!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
What did you get?
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Nice landing.
What did you find, Junior?
Where's my father?
All right! Where's my father
Who are you?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Interested in local curios?
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Who?
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
You understand what he tells us?
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
What's that?
You got the tickets, Short Round?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
That's far enough!
It is why Krishna brought you here.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
What'd he say?
And then they took their children.
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
He's afraid of something.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
It's okay. You're all right now.
What?
The last Sankara Stone.
My name is AL.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
Somebody's been here.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Who are you?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Why he's argumentative?
I want out.
I don't know...To get Al.
They could put you back in the tube..
Corridor A.
A lab and equipment.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Black suits and helmets.
I'm back.
You mean...just leave.
They'll know who I am.
It's just not enough.
Holy shit!
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
I don't want to eat it.
She doesn't seem to understand.
What happened?
Now, where would I be?
What did that cost?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Which one?
Just don't show fear.
They're all in it.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka.
Don't touch a thing.
What are you doing?
He was with Gruner!
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
I don't trust her.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
Left...The one with the red dot.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
She works for them.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
Awwww...
JOE What abilities...?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Me.
You've cut your hair?
We'll have to let them go.
What Job?
Yes?
I don't want to intrude.
...Foreign service.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
We're here.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
What do you do about what?
The poet...something he said...
I'll be right there.
And you.
Wait. What's your name?
And you?
I waited for you.
Trans Ocean Travel.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why did you stay with me?
Who else is interested in me?
Why did they leave?
He didn't.
You're leaving.
Hiroshima.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Now what?
That must be him. Water taxi.
What?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
What?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Now what?
Don't worry.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Who are you? Who do you work for?
He can't help us.
It wasn't me. It was him.
Come on.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
It will be fine. You have another.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Ow?...
It will.
Yeah? What for?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Yeah.
Mom.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
When's your deadline?
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
You're exaggerating!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm afraid you are.
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
Come again?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hey, Lowell.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
I can take her.
Uh, what are those boxes?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Did I get you up?
Give me a break!
Coffee?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Did work.
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
What do...
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Seven dwarfs?
The new place? New.
Why?
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Good. But Jeff...
Lowell, I can't afford --
You attract a crowd.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
What's changed?
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
I told the truth!
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What are you talking about?
What do you mean there is no family?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
"I would bet on it."
Object to the form of the question!
Object!
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Excuse me?
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
What?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Who was that?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
I assume this is on Rex?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
No.
He'll regret this.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Oh. And that is -- mom?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
No.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Honey, I could sit...
Hi.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Hello?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
I fell in love Miles.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Rex. Get away from the door.
We are. And it's winding down.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Do you need a Tagamet?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Who's that?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Wow.
Do you know him?
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
...arty farty!
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
And it's good!
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Hi, Sweetie.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Who said anything about a reward!
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Who is he?
Well!
Oh, noÂno.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onÂshe can raise some money on that?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meÂand maybe we'll be friendsÂ  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
I don't want it reported!
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
I never thought of that.
Of course I do. What do you meanÂ
Your ego is colossal.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
That, I suppose, makes everythingÂuhÂquite all right.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstÂthen the tieÂthen the shirtÂnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that IÂ
Do you mind putting out the light?
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
It takes money to buy food.
Yeah.
You're crazy.
PeterÂ
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
What's the matter?
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
Thought you were hungry!
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youÂcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught meÂgoodnight!
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeÂand hungryÂand everything looks black. It's a long movement like thisÂ  Âwith a follow through.
Here comes a car!
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
You might give me a little credit.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Any luck?
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceitedÂ
ÂsixÂsevenÂeightÂnineÂ
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andÂand scared.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffÂmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Mr. GordonÂ
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
What's the thousand bucks for?
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
What do you reckon that's for?
Not a minute!
Yeah.
Wife?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Yeah ?ÂHow do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If you don'tÂEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Right.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
Street cats?
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
What do you think, Lou?
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
Why?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
You know damn well who it is.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
You still questioning any Cubans?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
I want the truth.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
Aren't you being a little hard?
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
And if you're wrong?
They killed him, honey.
For sexual purposes?
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
What's wrong, Lou?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Goddamn Sam!
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
You know who the mayor was?
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Jim Garrison?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
What'd ya mean?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
How'd you know where he was?
And you didn't tell the Police?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
What's going on?
She sound scared?
What's she want?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
What's this?
But now you're telling us now you do.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
I'd love one, but not there.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
If you're having some.
Want to hear some music?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
Who is this?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
Fifteen thousand.
Does it happen to all men?
And Annette's it for you?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
What do you do when he comes home?
You do that?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
In a dress.
How'd you find out?
He's liable to shoot you.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Uh-huh.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
He say is a surprise.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
You know what we want.
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
How can you help us?
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Uh-huh.
You didn't count it?
Ever been tempted?
That would be one point of view.
I have no idea.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Sure.
What were you two fighting about?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He said he didn't know about it.
You think I'm kidding?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Jackie?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Didja tell 'em anything else?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
Can you cover that?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Who?
Drink?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
What does she think she's gettin?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Where at?
Want a Metrix?
Were you a disco guy?
Did you ever go I one?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
About five years ago.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Please.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
What are you doin'?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
As low as two.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
What's your relationship?
Uh-huh.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
You shot Melanie?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
How long was she in there?
What'd you shoot her with?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
That's Winston. He works here.
Yeah.
What's his full name?
Beaumont Livingston.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
House or apartment?
Comfortable?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
You didn't hear?
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Where is it?
You know who this is?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
That's all?
How the fuck did he find me?
My office.
She's all alone.
It's the next street.
My money's in that office, right?
Who is it?
We're back.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
He ain't here right now.
I'm alive.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Well, how do I look?
You're hurting me!
Daddy. Let go.
Well, try, huh.
What do you mean?
Hey, wait!
It's cold.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I am.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
I saw Sarah the other day.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Louis, you're a life saver.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Jacob, what can I do?
Where are you?
You up?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
I must have been out of my head.
What do you mean you can see?
I'm going home.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
You okay?
We're at Della's.
Can't you stop it?
How high is that?
What the hell are you doin'?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Don't gimme that.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
How come? The army?
While you were in the shower.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Who else were you expecting?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Are you out of your mind?
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where are they?
Why won't you answer me?
You look upset.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I can't move.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Push 'em back.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
The army?
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
On top of him?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Minimal.
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Can't shut em' down from here.
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
You see that?
Shit!
Hey! I'm not ready.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Sergeant!
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
What if you miss?
Hey.
What's this?
I couldn't save them.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
You wanna release your air tanks?
Rizzo, you okay?
It's time.
Spunky . . .
That's really funny.
Okay?!!
Close the fucking door!
Now this is getting exciting.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
You're so bossy.
What do we do?!!
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Almost done.
Sorry, sorry.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kicker!
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Jason? He's on this ship?!
What good will that do?
How do you open the damn door?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Just a favor for your old man.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
He's trying to sink us!
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
How come you have to tell them that?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
What's that?
He ate a car?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
What happened?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
You picked her up on the ferry.
You here for the summer?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
You love sharks?
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
What's that supposed to prove?
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Over there!
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Is that normal?
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Wizard!
Can we make out now?
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Cool it.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
What is it?
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Cute?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
What?
Oh, okay. Like this.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Can I take your coats?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Excuse me?
Yeah, like people in love.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Aha! You love him.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What did you do?
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
What would be a good time for you?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Happy birthday Adele.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
...I don't know.
What's wrong with her?
Tight fit.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
This the book your writing?
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
Yeah?
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
...and I think I know why.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
What's that?
Carrie, watch for Early.
...never?
You were plenty hot.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What happened?
Could be.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
...Diebold?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Yes. Altogether.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Were they wearing condoms?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
She can fuck?
Oh man, that's the best.
You know what else?
You wanna go to Paul's house?
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
You down with the boost?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
I don't understand why you do that.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
So really, it's good luck.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
You goin'?
Man we fucked him up.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
What?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Do you like kissing me?
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
You know what I want to do?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Hello.
The pain. The fucking pain!
You are being ripped open.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Just a lot of crazy shit.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Yep.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Hi mom.
So, how many people live here now?
Where does everyone sleep?
Yeah.
Right.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
What's that supposed to mean?
What do you mean, no?
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You're a lying bastard!
The message!  I figured out--
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
What are you talking about?
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Sorry.
You alright?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
You'll find her.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You know her?
Why her?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Yes?
It's me you want.  Not her.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
What's this?
No problem.  We're in.
Nope.  Nothing.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
Anything?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
Kathy?
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
As large as castles.
He's right, Kathy.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Answer the question.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Is this your first time here?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
That's a very personal question.
You.
What are you looking for?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I think it's interesting.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
No.
Doesn't that scare you?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
She died in a car accident.
What?
What is this?
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
Did you call?
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
Hi.
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Peter...
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Because I know what it says.
You're going to be late for your match.
You beat him.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
I lied.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Have they harmed you?
Will your power outward.
Take the western passage.
Yes.
In the Arctic ice.
That's a better one.
You will go alone.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
I can't reach her.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
<u>Why</u>?
Never.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
She must make a glaive.
The spiral begins in the west.
She can see the Beast!
How did you know?
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
You too are lonely.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
Once is enough, thank you.
Fame.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
And where do you lead, boy?
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
I'm hungry.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
And do you think I live on air?
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He is the King.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
He will not!
He will come for me.
Freylag's stronghold?
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
You know the voice.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Yes.
Look.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
But you would not stay with me.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
You will come with me.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...You moved too, didn't you?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Take...
Good! First shot!
The yellow and pink.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Come on, get down!
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Not taken.
Where are you going?
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
...Don't you drink?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
How are you, Miss?
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
He probably just went somewhere.
I don't accept that.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
What if you don't make it?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Mine.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
What steps do we take now?
So what's the deal Maurice?
I've seen it before.
It's a special day isn't it?
I do love you... very, very much.
I know where my heaven is.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Perhaps there's another route?
You're walking to California?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
What do your friends call you?
I don't have kids.
Where did he go?
What's your shoe size?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
What do you want?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Water?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
Sarah -- with an H?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Do you want to fuck now?
If I was I'm sorry.
Thank you. What time is it?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
I am planning to go out and do some work.
What do you mean?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I like it here with you.
Will you lighten up, please?
How'd this happen?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Where have you been?
A full night on the street and this is all?
But it's a top three school --
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
Why would I kill my husband?
What?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
I'm sorry, but --
You're hitting on me?
So everything you just said --
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
You can't even imagine.
After you went to all that trouble?
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
The idiot speaks.
I'm a bitch.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Here. You're gonna need this.
Picking out my wedding dress!
Josh proposed!
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Don't ask.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
I can't.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
You really think I'm attractive?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Whoa -- Why?
So now you're -- ?
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Amazing how?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
You go where?
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Where?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
More fun win battle?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Yes?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
Might we watch, too?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
What do I do?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
Aye!  That too.
Fine-looking army.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Good.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Nice piece of work.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Can we trust him?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
What magic have we on our side?
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
We seek to undo the curse.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
But you did... you did!
I detest serpents.
What shall we do?
How much longer?
Where are you going?
What happened?
He did run?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
My lady mocks me.
I'm afraid it may storm.
Tis not fit for a princess.
What have I done?
No!  I won't let it happen...
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
What?
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Biting you?
Pinching?  Where?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Step lively now!
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
In every way.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Please...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Can you show us the way?
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
And video games after!
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I'm going to bed.
Are you his friend?
Did you feel anything?
Hey.
He's a freak.
I wanted him to marry her.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Why are you so uptight?
Josh said...
I was wondering.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
You hate your father.
Where are you?!
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Why is that?
He's at work while I'm here.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Are you guys' friends?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I'm good, thanks.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Forty.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Is Alyssa home?
Sam?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Is Alyssa here?
I did warn you.
Hello?
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
I'm leaving.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
You're too fucking late.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know parts of who you are.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Are you talking?
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
You look better than ever.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What would you do?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Because Dad left?
Lock the door behind you.
Four days.  I left to think.
I need to talk to you.
I was parked in day parking.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
I love those doors.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
Is your back still killing you?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
The biggest waste of time since television.
I'm helping George build his house.
I was talking about our marriage.
Despite you.
You could keep it and rent it out?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Adam, that's not true!
Go tell your father we're eating.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Yeah...
Sharp.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
I've never seen you in here before.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Where they taking us, anyway?
Start your job? What kind of job?
What?
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
My daddy gave me this watch.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Alright. You want some pie?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
This fork is filthy.
You know what I'm saying.
What does that mean?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
No.
What'd you say?
Don't mention it.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
What?!
What the hell are you doing?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
It's too late for plans.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
How about some steak sauce?
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
So it don't exist.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What do you think about that?
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Who?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Hello, Cassius.
No!
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Try an angel.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I didn't murder anybody
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Now everybody sit down.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
You came through, Nicky.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
Boogerland!
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
Which way did he go?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Hello.
The South.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
You have a dog? What kind?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Valerie?
..."The Devil?"...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Answer the question!
I am.
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
What's your name?
Well then...?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Later.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I'm listening.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
I'm afraid.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
What belongs to the people?
What people?
We'll have to bury him.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
I'm sorry.
Can you make it back?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
You're not contagious are you?
Pete... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Why not?
Why not?
Very strange.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
You recognize that guy?
What's that, Ed?
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Pete?
I don't know.
What deal?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
You got him.
Dick Laurent?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Yeah.
What's up?
You don't look so good.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
One of the guards must have leaked it.
What's the matter?
We know that.
I won't ever tailgate.
We've met before, haven't we?
Does it say anything on the tape?
It must be from a real estate agent.
Where would you feel safe?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Suit yourself, champ.
Okay.
What are you guys doin'?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
What do you want?
Why don't you like me?
What about those men we met this morning?
Fossils, huh?
Sorry.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Where are they? Do you see them?
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Certainly not.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Âthen the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Cave, eh? Where?
You mean you don't want to go?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
And mine's Conway.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Âbuy and sell?
Who?
When was all this?
Well, is it?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
It's astonishing - and incredible, butÂ
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Bob, these are all that are left.
George, what are you going to do?
What is it? Has he fainted?
He's dead.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
George, come back!
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turnedÂ
Maria?
What's she got to do with it?
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Where did you come from?
Good.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
What is?
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Ouch!
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
You'll wait till you rot!
The hell were you thinking?
You do?
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
We'll take it from here.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
What?
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
How does that help me?
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
Since how long?
Would you call this a code 100?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
in case I need it?
You were saying?
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Nowhere.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
This it?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
And they're buying it?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Actually, I don't know...
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
What?
No.  Follow him.
Oh, God...
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
She grew up.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
-- but he didn't.
About who?
John?  What is it?
That's not much.
You made those tapes...
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
Kill type?
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Lara called me.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
To them.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
But you call this room the "temple".
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
What the hell.
I forgive you...
Sean, wait...
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
What about the picture --
Let go of the gun.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
What's so funny?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
What safe place is that?
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
How do I even know which one has it?
John?
I understand.
The guy from USA Today is here.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Congratulations, sir.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
John Anderton was my friend!
He looks familiar.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
I don't have any sugar either.
Since right after we lost our son.
It was nobody's fault.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
I can take you down there.
Not on me, sir.
I don't get it. What do you do?
I know.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
Uncle Bobby?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Oh my god. What happened?
I feel weird asking him.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I never promised you anything.
Get your hands off of her.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
What's up? Jess ready?
What's his name?
Where is this happening?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Heard of them.
Where's Ricky?
This is it.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
What's that?
Nah.
Where is the Soho Grand?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
No. Just the cross streets.
Yeah?
What about it?
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Nice work.
I don't know.
I'll get the girl.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
You fucking nuts?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
We need guns.
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
What about it?
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Kinda. Yeah.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Yeah. I want it.
You want to come splash around.
I want to leave right now.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
You look good, man.
How do you know it's not drugs?
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
Ow, shit...
I'm half Irish.
No?
Coke?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Come, now. You just got here.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
So whenever we want...
I get it.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
How's it feel?
It hit?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Let Billie finish.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Man, what do you want?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
Don't con me.
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
I can't make out that shit.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Where am I gonna start?
I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
I see your point.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
I'll be away a lot.
I just want to sit here and be still.
We need you too!
Get some sleep.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
"His greatest greatness."
You know that gal?
Did you hear me?!
How many you turning out?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Let me die then.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
That's a fine chick.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
That ain't bad.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
[Senor?]
[What is his name?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
How does it affect you?
Yeah, right...
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
You mean a misfire?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
No.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
We're taking a different way home.
You're fast.
Well, I let him go.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
The blocks.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Where are you?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
She likes him.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
[I know this. Your point?]
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
Waddaya gonna do now?
It's early.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
All right, I'll see you!
Who you gonna call?
Are you kidding?
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Who?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Ufa!
Ah?
Who?
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
It pains that they should do this.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Yeah.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
No...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
I'm stag.
What?
Are you kidding?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
What time is it?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Sure. This girl said...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
What?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
...and they sit down right next to me...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
Tommy...
Wadda you so sore about?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Don't you use olives?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
You Â must Â open Â me Â up Â again?
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
Wisconsin.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Any time. Whenever we want.
Is that liquor?
Give us this day our daily...
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
I think I heard about that.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Look.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
See you.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
How did you get called that?
You're an attractive man.
Very happily married.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
They missed the boat.
What's wrong with him?
No, never in the slightest.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
How much time do I have?
The blonde dish.
About that chest-cutter...
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
Yes, that's what I mean.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Sir?
Sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Hello, John.
Ted Sheldon.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Did you write this?
Thank you very much for everything.
Better let me talk to him.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
That's good.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
The letter.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Say that again.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Hurry up, Pop.
Well, maybe you're right.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayÂhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Has he been here?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
What do they want?
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
St-rike!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
No!
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfÂI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named JeffersonÂand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andÂI'll eat him.
What are you doing up here then?
How about family? Got any family?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's a lie!
Flowers.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get aÂ
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Not that we know of.
Floor seats.
What's the line?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Don't make do it, Mike.
Who's controlling your mind?
Tell me what's wrong.
Hold on a second here.
Hi, Roper.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
It's all there.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
We see each other every couple of months.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Where did you hear that?
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
What's the first commandment?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
To run last?
The 6 horse is still last.
Is the hostage injured?
I know how you feel, Ray.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
You like this place?
Stay here, don't move.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie?
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Scott...
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Stay up there, Girl...
Roper.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Repoed this morning.
What do you want?
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
She said I have a son...
Your life that bad?
Do you believe in miracles?
The guests are here.
It's time to wake up.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
But what if he doesn't --
How long 'till we can eject?
Take care.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
You're jumping to conclusions.
One condition.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
But I don't know anything about programming.
And it meant something.
I wasn't with you.
It was just there.
Program name?
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
We've got him locked!
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Release the power with the power.
Anybody see anything?
Release the power WITH the power.
I see... a fox
PTERODACTYL!
All systems go!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Here you go!  No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
It's... an eagle?
... A falcon?
GET OFF ME!
But boss, what about their parents?
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
How the heck?!...
THREE SECONDS!!
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
We're asking you to go to prison.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Boo-Boo.
Up here, Boss.
And now you have everything.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
No. They envy you.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
You could have stopped him.
Would it be painful for you?
Who'll make the rules?
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
I been thinkin'...
I'll handle the Boss.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
You boys carryin' pieces?
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
You get fifteen percent.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
We must be friends, Charlie.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
The Big Picture.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Wanna know what I think?
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Forget it.
Yes?
Luciano is dead?
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Monkeybone?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
DEATH!!
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piĹata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
Holy shit.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Stu?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Where'd he go??
Stu...LOOK!
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mother, I ...
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
It was?
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
You've never *seen* this contract.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Tell me why!
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What! Who?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Oh--yeah--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Why do I always laugh at that?
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Where?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
All right, why?
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
*But you never asked me*!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Washington!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Will the Senator yield?
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Yes, I was--
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Yield *how*, sir?
Mr. President--
Will the Senator--
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Fine--
Just fine.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
What's your name?
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Committee.
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
On paper?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
I know. It's--Violet.
Abigail.
Letitia.
Lena.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
What do they--? Who are all those--?
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Yay!
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Nice *compliment*!
No?
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
That's him. Let him in.
What do you think?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jim!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
His first 'whiff'!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Senator Paine will state it!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Yes.
Since he was born.
They think he's pixilated.
He's still pixilated.
No. Are you?
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Are they true!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
What?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
Sure. I met you.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
Here's a nice place.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
In a day or so, I think.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
What's the matter, hon?
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
People have been crucified before.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Look, I can do it!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
How'd you get the picture?
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
That's the rub.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Yes, but you saidÂ
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
How is this, sir?
Relatives of old man Semple.
Nuisance value?
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Where?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
How do you do.
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
That's funny. Why is that?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Naturally.
Let him alone.
Âmy wife wanted me to tell you sheÂ  Âshe prays for you every night.
Mrs. Semple?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Well, I don't know. IÂ
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Your HonorÂ
Uh-huh.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpetÂ  Âthanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Tails tonight, sir?
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
But she's on the telephoneÂ
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
What an asshole!
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Why? I'm paying for this.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
What?
You do?
It was Henry Follett.
What do you want to know?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
And the Brocketts?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
What it might take is... doing time.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Can you help Mom?
What's happening here?
Do you think that's a good idea?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
I think you do.
Wow. You're something.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Mom's such a cutie.
Please... forgive me.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Is that when you split up?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Well, there's Lily.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
"Get to know your therapist."
But look at me now...
At least you pulled yourself out...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Sorry...
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
You know where he's taking her?
I never killed a priest before.
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Goin' somewhere?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Two hundred pounds.
Fifty percent.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
That "thing" gets me excited.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Why would I do that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I think you were jealous
Have you no respect for the dead?
Jonathan?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
I'm your sister.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Hey,... don't I know you?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
You did not!?... We're not!?
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
We gotta get her back.
I knew you'd know.
Our guests are waiting.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
We could really use some coffee --
Who are you?
No one will believe us.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Yes!
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Have you considered my offer?
They always call the great ones nuts.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
I'd better go.
What?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Or talk?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
Oh don't start that again --
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
Cover me!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
The who?
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Roy --
What's that?
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Wow.
Jeffrey!
It's on the television.
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
It is?
To us!
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
I'm glad you like it.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
And who is defending Paris?
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Yes, sir?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Ah-hh, no.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
My God...!  What time is it?
When did it start?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
That is correct.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Oh...?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
No... nothing at all.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
You couldn't face telling me what?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
You could hear them?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Stretch it out.
Where you going?
No I'm not.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Me neither.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
This you?
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
You straight?
What?
Who is that?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
$247.
What's the matter?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
What we gonna do?
Yeah, air.
You go first.
You're welcome, Unc.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
You want us to give you a ride?
Delivery!
I don't play for no team.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Here I come!
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Craig, remember what I told you.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
What is it?
Are they still out there?
Roach...Roach, come on.
He's inside the house?
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Where's Craig?
What the fuck you looking at?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Where did Craig move to?
Debo!  Debo!
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, how you get out of here.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Mr. Nasty time?
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
All right, I'll do it.
Where to, sir?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
Somebody close?
You were very nervous.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Yes, yes, I understand.
I will do no such thing.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
I think you better put that away.
Lynn!
Can we go now?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Please. Something is going to happen...
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
That's pretty good.
I've got something for you.
I'm looking for them.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
Yeah.
No, Ben.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
Just went?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
John, where's your folks?
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
All right boy: where's the money?
All right...  Come along.
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
I'll tell you a secret.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
What's their names?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
How's that?
What do you figure to do?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Are you through praying?
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
What do you want?
Pearl and John!
He never asked me for nothin'.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
How can you tell?
What the hell's going on!?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Yeah. So?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
The killer.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Rod's not a lunatic.
She dreamed this would happen...
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Who? Who did that?
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Screw sleep!
What's with the bars?
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
I never touched her.
Rod says the sweetest things.
What the hell you doing here?
You feel better now, right?
Thank you, Comrade.
What are you serving?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Yes.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You feel it, though.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Capitalistic methods...
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Which lawyer?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Guest?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Good morning, Your Highness.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
We don't want to be disturbed.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Give me another double brandy.
Private.
Confess what?
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
What for... why?
You, please.
How long do we have to wait here?
In other words you don't know.
Thank you.
And where are we?
Suppress it.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Then you don't want me to go there.
What do we do now?
Is that customary?
And what is your profession?
And what do you do for mankind?
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
Thank you.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
I didn't follow you.
Because we are an odd couple.
I have never heard one.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
You remember this room?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
Not white, darling.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Radio! What is radio?
What shall we get? The news!
It's dead.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Yes, Swana.
Yes, Swana.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
Where are they?
Where are they?
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
May I have your bags, madame?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Where to, madame?
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
We could check the tape again, sir.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
How's the job coming, Bob?
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Why not?
We can't touch Hoover --
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
About a dozen.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
More light, chief?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
Ummm...
Oh, my goodness ...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
I never met the man.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
You're fucking me.
Who we working for?
Mein Kampf?
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
No, Henry.  I don't.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
How about Kissinger along with him?
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
How many?
You all right?
But it was all we had.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Where you from?
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
So I'm supposed to be ...
Of them.
We lost ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
Dick, don't...
You don't have to go.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
This.  Above all.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Penny for your thoughts.
Hiding what?
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
How fresh is this coffee?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
Nineteen zero and nine.
None of that explains your man though.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Yes ma'am?
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
Yessir.
Don't hurt no one.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
You gave your word?
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
I need to know that.
What're you doin', baby?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Huh? What is...
What airport would you use.
All right.
Didn't mean nothin'.
Now. We close now.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Good. I need everything else.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Yessir.
You tell me the option.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Then you'll like me.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
What did you do?
Were you in Nam?
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Why would he go to Odessa?
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
What outfit.
How is she?
Could I have that in American?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
A woman can write a check.
You're lying!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Great. Good. Content...
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
No... what about your sister?
It's all right.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
That's very kind of you.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Of course.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Thanks...
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
...well, then you ain't got much.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
How did you know?
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
It's something I had to do. For David.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
The Five?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Does he know you think he's real?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
The fuck you talking about?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That's right.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
We can live with that.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Joyce was screwing Del.
We should go.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
I never said that I believed...
Who's this?
I said 'got it?'
This is Betty at twelve.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
...and how long did she work here?
But she wanted more out of life, right?
I see.  May I?
Hmm?
Is there a problem, George?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Yeah? The sport utility?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Her show?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
What do we do now, Everett?
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Izzat right?
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Pete have a brother?
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
Suckin' away.
Devil his due.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I counted to three, honey.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Who was fixing to betray us!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
But...
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Pete... I do apologize.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Come back here, kid!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Who gave you this idea?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Zack, we've got to go.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Mayo, are those your friends?
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
What did you call me?
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Yes I do!
Something tells me you've been here before.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
You what?
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
What did you tell him about the baby?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
What's the matter?
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Do you know that for sure?
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
Sid, what happened?
No problem.
What if she called the cops?
He said open it.
You should see the look on your face.
Me.  I am.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
She's gonna handle it.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Where did you get this clown?
Cell phone.
You don't look so good.
Could the child please stop that?
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
That's highly inappropriate.
Cut it back a little bit.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
He's going down.
Damn it!
Can't hear a thing.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU HAVE TO!
What, what, what is it?!
We're never getting out of here.
Do it.
He'll do something.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
What if I spazz out?
Where is the Glucogen?
Well... is it loaded?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
What's up?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Inspector Brimmer
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
You want me to put a man on it?
That's right brother... listen and learn.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
I saw... but...
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Motherfuckers...
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
This cool the heat off you any?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
You believe that?
When?
Congratulations.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You look well, Charlotte.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Excuse me?
Shall we proceed?
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
How can we end this madness?
Do you see that, Colonel?
And the Governor?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
How old are you?
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
You learned her lessons better than I.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
No, I don't.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
You don't hate him.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
We saw.
Where is he now?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not held, just slowed down.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Don't worry.
Reverend.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Father?
Who might you be, little Miss?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Yes, but the rope might be--
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
What's up, sugar?
I don't get it.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
What were you listening to?
You folks ready to go on?
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Going to tell Ellie?
Yes, but--
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
And Buckaroo Banzai.
She's finally asleep.
I heard you tonight.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
I'm going to try to do better.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
You are despicable.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Say again?
How did you get off the island?
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Dead serious.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Where does it make berth?
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
Why are brothering with that?
Is that so?
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You haven't seen it.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
... plastic.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
I know what you're doing.
Like rotting meat.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What are you going to do?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Is that what Argon told you?
You're afraid of him.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
Yeah.
Nothing really worthwhile.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Why do we need it?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
That was an egg?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
What's that supposed to mean?
Just like old times.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
How far can you stretch?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Susie... I...
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Exactly.
I think I better go, Stew.
Don't mind Mother.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
Where did you get those letters?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Really?
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spotÂ
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
I'm not going!
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
What's the idea, Anne?
Âand if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
This way.
Oh, is that so?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Look, I quit!
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooeyÂ  Let me know when you're quitting.
How do you like your bath, sir?
Who are you?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
That's a lovely dress.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
My error.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
How far have you gotten?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Did who?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
What did he want?
What other girlÂ?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Now don't be absurd, SmithÂ  May I come in?
Okay - you remember JoeÂ
What is it, Smythe?
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Nobody seems to want to do anythingÂ  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
But IÂ
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
And they won't be able to tell?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Having kind of a tough time.
What?
What is that?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
But where would we go?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
It's six-thirty ...
Don't! Just let go.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
But it could happen.
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Did you do this?
Do you know that it's illegal?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
It's like the basketball team.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
What's outside of Pleasantville?
What color is that hedge of yours?
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
What did you do?
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
What do you mean?
What's wrong?
You're reading?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Can I ask you a question?
Keeps going ...
Hi.
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
What do we do?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
... Her father.
Hello there.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
OW!
There's worse places.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Do you have the lettuce?
Oh hi!
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
This is Barry.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
You just said very food.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Nothing.
Where are you?
Sure.
No.
Hi....what....what's up....?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
It was cool last night.
Hello?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
This is funny.
Alright?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
You like her?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
No I didn't say that.
What did he want?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
There's a better place for us to eat.
Did you pick it up from the street?
Oh that's great.
Yeah.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
Where you married?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Do you wanna have sex?
For work.....
That's right you travel so much.
Are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Did you have my home phone number?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Why?
Yeah.
No.
I cut myself.
I didn't do that.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
What do you mean?
And your name?
And your Social Security number.
It's ok, take your time.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
You ok?
Why you wearin' a suit?
What is this?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
What's up?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
I need to talk to you for a second.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Nothing.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Seven o'clock.
Ok.
I know.
I don't really remember that.
That's cool.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Madeleine --
Go back to your room. Quickly.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
You mean to take us all down with you?
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
-- water! --
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
Well?
It was fiction, of course.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
As you say, Doctor.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
But I am history.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'll pass the word on, then.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
...yes, I've got that bit...
"...your wife."
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
-- words alone are insufficient.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Good God, Marquise --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Doesn't that please you?
You're just scared.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Oh, why is that?
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
This picture--
Then you explain it to me?!
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
I just want to understand--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Thank you for your time
He lied to me
I want blood
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Nope.
Sigmund Freud?
Jesus
Oh for Christ's sake-
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
I don't have it anymore?!
It doesn't have to be
He'll destroy us.
How?
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Why her?
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
It's good, huh?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Craig is one syllable
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
You gonna watch?
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Very generous
You're going to destroy it
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
For the title
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
You're not still mad at me, I hope
Oh God. . .
It was the best, kid
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Hey champ!
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
Where you going at this hour?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Sure. What is it?
Jack, I got no gloves.
Answer me when I talk to you.
Go 'head.
How do you know? You know her that good?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
What do you mean, "you"?
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
I can't find my ball.
Now take the rest off.
I like the gym smell.
I was just...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
You're not interested in him?
You asleep?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
I called. You weren't there.
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
Jake --
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Open the door, Vickie.
But they don't have a case against you.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
No, you're his wife.
It don't look right.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
His wife took a trip.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Hello.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Jeff --
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
That's normal.
That's abnormal.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
She's only perfect.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Huh?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
One hundred and twenty-seven.
What about the rest?
How's your leg?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Something big going on somewhere?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
What a day I've had!
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
What are you getting at?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
I'll rephrase the question.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Wasn't that close?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Shut up. I'm all right.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Machismo?
Just him.
Sure.  It's fine.
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
How'd he get in?
Any other entrance?
No.  We're going to bring him down.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
No.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
You thought I was Mom?
Blood.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Go ahead.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Are you going down there?
See?  It stopped.
Frank!
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Hi.
Boy!
I'm here.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Jim!
Come out come out wherever you are!
Let's see how long we can stay under.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
You sure?
I shot at one of them.
Plato!
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Okay--
The kids take me.
Goodbye!  See you!
It doesn't matter to them.
I'm getting that way, too.
Where you going?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
You can't talk underwater!
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
What?
I never felt so clean before.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Hi, Plato!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
She's being called for.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Searching for a money man...
I've been doing good, though.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
Saw me --
No, c'mon --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Where the hell are you going?
You forget where I work?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
No, Nick, no --
Nick died for me....
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
No!
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
You... you... YOU --
I had better sex in prison.
What'd they call her in college?
What's her greatest fear?
Hey, it's... been two years --
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Do I get a country-western name?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
You got one hour.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
What'd you tell that casino manager?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
Start singing.
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
...so where is he?
The Powwow Safe?
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
How long ago was your makeover?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Hot chocolate.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
GUARD! GUARD!
Tell Ashley... I...
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
That was my king!
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
We can work this out, can't we?
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
I don't know, but somebody did.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Mr. Brown?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
How is he?
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
What's that?
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Why?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
What happened?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Want a smoke?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
I got 'em, all right?
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Tell them to come on in.
What's the matter with her?
But you eat, don't you?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
But the rest is right.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
Don't you trust me?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
I've got eleven horses.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
You know what she asked me?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Goodbye and thanks.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Maybe I better start working on him.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
I said let's go.
We got company. Female company.
Gee, I can't.
And that's tough, isn't it?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Well, Steve?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
Hey, Brenda.
Me, too. 101?
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Really? That's amazing.
Oh my God! We're dead!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Shhh... It's okay.
Ray, run faster.
Hey, you left your book back there.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Hi Buddy.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Buddy...
What about you, Buddy?
Feel that?
What should we get?
Okay, I get the point.
Let her go, Cin.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
This can't be happening?
What the hell are you doing?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Did you do that?
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
I got it!
I think she's starting to suspect something?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Hello Dwight.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
You never could feel your legs.
Would you like to see the girl?
What does it say?
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
What a bitch!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
In here, Mom...
Detectives, what is this about?
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
You bring me such peace...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Objection! Argumentative!
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
So you do drink?
State your name, please.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
That's like your car, Beverly,
Mrs... Sutphin?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Are we leaving?
What is it, Betty?
I'll give you fifty cents.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ÂÂ  -- used a phony health inspector's badge ÂÂ they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I'll give you a check.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village Â-	"The Dante."
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Redi's all right.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
This is about another murder ÂÂ a woman at Fifty Second Street
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Well?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
Who are you?
I have been at the library.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one Â so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -Â he doesn't make her laugh ÂÂ he just sits and talks.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
What was she to you?
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it ÂÂ your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
Yes.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Graham is an unusual name.
Oh, uh-huh.
You play an instrument?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Oh, uh-huh.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
So what about kids?
Does it bother you?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Are you in the middle of something?
What are these?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
What... what are these interviews about?
About sex?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
You know?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
That's a good question.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
Have you fantasized about me?
Can't.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
You're really never going to make love again?
But if you were?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
But that was part of it?
Like maybe a big part?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I can't tell you like this.
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Something wrong?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
I'm not either!!
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Loud.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
What are you talking about?
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Lose something?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I just thought it might --
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
Because I never got around to it.
No!
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
I was just trying to --
Bye.
No, I touched me.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
I just want to know why you're here.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
She didn't give you my address?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Would anybody else see the tape?
And you ask questions, right?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
No.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
Hello.
Hello.
John Millaney.
Do you want me to stop calling?
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Why not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Plenty of room for two people.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
What tapes?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Medical clinic?
Where is he now? Do you know?
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
What happened?
Want me to breathe deeply?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
I don't get it.
Yeah? What do I do then?
NIGHT NIGHT
You bet, Bert.
About Brad's family?
You got it!
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
When do I get to see Brad?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
A free thinker.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
You shouldn't have said that.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
I'm...happy.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
. . .For his own good.
Our speciality.
Our field.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Isn't she lovely?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
What do you think?
They're from both of us.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Hi.
Are you a writer too?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
That's your problem, Miles.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
That's what you do with every one.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
We're on.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Where is Stephanie?
What?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Nice shot.
What do you think's going on?
Been checking your messages?
I said okay?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Let me use your phone.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
You know what I'm thinking?
So what's the plan?
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Want me to drive?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
What the fuck!
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Nice. Very nice.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Yeah, weird. But great.
So what's your novel about?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Yeah? Like what?
Okay. See you around.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Maya.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Sir, what are you doing?
So what do you think?
That was fun last night.
Huh.
It was a surprise, Mom.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I don't want you to die.
You do?
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Explain noises.
That roof is over ten feet high.
It's noise.
Morgan, be careful.
Where are you going?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Merrill!
They're broadcasting...
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
These are D's; I need double A's.
We might lose the signal.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
Stop crying!
I can't even imagine.
Did someone save me?
It's the strangest thing Father.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
I don't think so.
Is anything missing?
Is that him?
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
McKendrick's men got him.
Are you all right?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
You're not Baxter?
Offend anybody lately?
Women?
Who?
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
New record.
What are you talking about?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
The jury saw it differently.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why him?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
I've given that up.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
You really are a gambler.
Where's the dog now?
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- What's wrong with that?
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- It's called a projector.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Hair and make-up?
Even the fall from the plane?
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
-- You can't go in there!
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
Really?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
... Simone.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Hello?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
No, I'm okay.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Hal, what are you doing?
You can't.
There's... a wall between you --
You have to see her.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
There was no other way.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Can't you stop that?
How?
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Good-night, Daddy.
She thinks you're with Simone.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I know what you're up to.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
What now, Sayer?
Is it a jamming device?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
I am the death of real.
Wow. They called you their son.
Are you calling me?
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Don't step in the horse manure.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
What were they hiding from?
I'm going to see you again, right?
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
Where should I look then, Cole?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
What kind of words?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
...No.
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
--What?
Something happened, didn't it?
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
Just help.
And you know what else?
They're right here.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
You know that accident up there?
Where is she?
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Stuttering Stanley!
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Fuck you.
Witch.
Bitch.
Hi.
Aha. The Lovers.
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Carl, what are you doing?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
You're out of your mind, man.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
It's time to make amends.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Ow!
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Is that right?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Suzie --
Carl.
Someone better tell Mac.
Shit.
What?
What you up to?
Grant, where'd you go?
What?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Where are you going?
You're my princess, aren't you?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
When one sees you they all see you.
Praise Jesus.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Who'd want to?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Well?...
What the hell's going on?
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
One to five?
What can I say?
He's just exhausted.
Why should I?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Or in the slammer.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Shit! No one's here.
Hit the brakes!
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
Bandit?
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
We're outta motion lotion.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
I think you're just yellow.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
No.
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
And this is your car, isn't it?
...I forgive you Darwin.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Man, that's great.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
What'd you say?
About what?
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I did it?
...I'm sorry...
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
Where's Israel?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...Yeah, fifty-three.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Shoot.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
What were you doin' here anyway?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
Gibarian.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
You killed her!
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
How much sleep do you need?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Kelvin, you awake?
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
What happened?
What plan?
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
What do you remember?
Is it a planet?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Why did you say those things?
You don't want me.
Do you want to stay here?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Where did you go before?
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Snow, get up here, now.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Occasionally.
Straight ahead.
Hi.
You live in Manhattan?
Would you pick one out, please?
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
He said he'd kill me.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Didn't do very well, did you?
So, this could be your last night, huh?
What's to like?
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
You don't want to know.
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Claire...
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
So how'd it go?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Okay?
She's got to identify him.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Mike, take it easy...
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
You in this with me?
No, I will not step outside.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Let my kid go.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Nice threads Dad.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Sexual tension...
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Lizzy!
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
You get mugged or something?
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Yeah--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Would you cool it already?
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
You should write that one down.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Well, no.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Peter?
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Toxic dumps, huh.
You sure about all this?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
I am old enough to--
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Peter, what can I do for you?
Need any more help?
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Up here, Docky Ocky!
What's the match gag?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
105-353.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
You can say that again!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
You want Betty Grable!
No, Animal.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
That's what I wanna hear.
You're crying, Animal.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Go on.
What are we going to do with him?
You could use a new one yourself.
I'll kill you for that!
Good morning, Sefton.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
Is it all right if we smell it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
Where is he now?
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
This is its current position.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
What?
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
Left behind?
These are my children...my children.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
Oh
But I do have a theory...
Keep her together until I get back.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Sir?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Maybe they're not out there.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Status!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Still no response, sir.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Why don't we beam it up?
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
David, I don't understand...
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Later. Let's go...
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I don't understand.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
The Genesis planet is gone.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
See! That shimmering area.
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Would you look at that?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.

David?... David!
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
He asked you not to grieve...
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
So!  Speak!
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
500 Kellicams!
My Lord... what are your orders?
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
You amaze me, Commander.
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Now that's what I call a meal.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
I still don't under --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
... Can't read you... repeat...
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
David. Please.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
He's on a build up to detonation!
We encoded four minutes --
I don't mean to intrude.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
What are you looking at?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
Well?
Departing dark side, Regula.
Genesis, what's that?
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Scotty -- what's left?
Just barely, sir.
She's not responding...
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Gentlemen, this isn't --
What's she doing here?
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
The prefix code?
... the good of the few...
In my quarters, Uhura.
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
And why not?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
On screen...
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Time from my mark...
Admiral on the bridge!
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Admiral on the bridge --
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Fire all phasers...!
He's very human.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
I do not understand the final question...
The question is irrelevant.
Humans make illogical decisions...
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Bones, stay here.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
An experimental device, doctor.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
My name?
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
"Neutralized?" How?
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
It's true... what you said...
Steady, now. We need your help.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
I meant --
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
I have no control, sir!
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Estimate range, ship to whales!
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
I'll have to re-energize.
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Right on. You fly?
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Will it?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Chase me!
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Anij!
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
You're not going to launch anything until...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Will that stop the tear?
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
Deck five.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Captain...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
All hands. Battle stations!
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
Isn't it better like this...?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Can you configure it?
Dispersive armor is holding.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
Where?
This must be it.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Jean-Luc Picard.
There is no invasion...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Did you need something?
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
We?
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Life signs?
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Return to our own time?
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Wil... Data was down there.
Worf to Bridge.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
I believe the operation is over.
Or not to be -
Uh, Jim...
Are we playing multiple choice?
What is it with you, anyway?
We're explorers not diplomats!
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
WHAT HAPPENED?
What?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
And what did they tell you?
Spoken by you?
Shields. Battle stations.
Course heading, Captain?
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Klingon blood.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
An accident wasn't good enough...
What took you so long?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
This is incredible -
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Captain, our shields -- !
Just the prototype.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
Are you dining on worms?
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Uhura?
How did you - ?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Any progress?
If you are logical.
Trouble?
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Can you remember our father?
No. I must deactivate you.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little oleÂ me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I donÂt show up for my physical on time!
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
So... To happy endings.
To new worlds...
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
He is very observant.
A bit less florid, Data.
What do you imagine this is?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
What purpose does this serve?
Counselor.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
What's he doing?
Deanna, on my mark.
New Praetor?

Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
I won't do it.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Sir --
Why don't they answer our hails?
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
Looking up at the stars.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
With a full head of hair.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
What are you doing?
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Yes.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Right in line with that burning tree.
Benny, there's nothing there.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
It's real, George.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Hello George.
What's all this for?
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
That's the chance we have to take.
Mrs. Haydn...
Please...
What?
Dashboard.
Go.
Closed?
What?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
No gas.
Who?
In your pocket, please...
I...
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
Why are you going here? What is here?
When do you have to be here?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Say it.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
The captain...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
It's bad.
Yes.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
I will go. But not you.
Where are you going?
No one's traveling in this weather.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Good morning.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
Slow down, slow down.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Jesus.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
That's a good one, coming from you.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
You think Tran killed her?
Talk to me about costs, here.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
Let's work it.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So've I.  Too much.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Faith OK?
Looks like she was holding out.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
I always do.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
What the fuck are you doing?
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
And what about the guy that was following me?
This is bad.
Those two guys were cops.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
Got your ticket?
Testa?
Have you had a chance to think about --
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
You tell me.
You heard?
You have the body?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Excuse me?
Look, mister...
My God.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
You have the photo from the diner?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Doesn't fit.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
He thinks he looks young.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
He's called a couple times.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Then there's the other issue.
Start killing people for real?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
So you went underground?
I don't carry it with me.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
I've been to Chicago.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
I want to go live with you.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Koessler?
"MyDick?"
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Ever since I've known you.
You should call your Grandmother.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Yeah.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Like what?
What else?
To do what?
...not until you book it...
They're out of Glenlivet.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Well, who represents you back east?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...well, it suits you...
How's it going? It's been a while...
Good.  I think about things.
I miss you, Mike.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So I don't call either way.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I don't talk about her that much.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
How many strokes?
Oh.  Where is this place?
Kinda money, huh?
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Darwinism at its best.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
There are so many beautiful women here.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
I'm such an asshole.
They turned you down?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Then why won't she call...?
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Who threw this party, anyway?
She was cute.
You live in such a fantasy world...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Mike?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
Tonight, baby.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
You're gonna screw up our plan.
That's where we make our scene.
You gotta do it.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
I don't know...
That's bullshit.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I know. I know.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
No!
...So give me the fuckin part...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Christy was nice...
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
What time's this party tonight?
Who? Rob?
I'm sorry.
Was I money?
How long do I wait to call?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Oh, it's on, baby...
It's on.
You're money.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Shut up, Sue...
It's on...
The bear's got his claws back.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
What do you wish me to do?
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
What was that?
The food is on the table.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
You look terrif on the floor!
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
No.
You take care of your family?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
What is this nonsense?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
No, I wanted other things for you.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Corleone.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Ever seen anything like that before?
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
One of Tattaglia's people?
Jesus, I don't know...
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
What about McCluskey?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
Michael, what are you doing?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
He'll be OK.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
When will I see you again?
Will you?
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
How can you be sure?
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
We're going to New Jersey?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Is he alive?
Uncanny!
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I'm never going back!
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
Good afternoon!
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I have to go to Venice.
What does he say?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Who is it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
I guess.
Hardly.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
Tom.
Okay.
I never said that!
That ring's so great. The green one.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Where does Dickie live?
I was looking forward to seeing him.
That's a terrific idea.
Look at me what?
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
Is this you?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
My God.
No.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Are you okay?
What do you mean lied about who you are?
And don't forget. I have the key.
Thank you.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
How much for everything.
You like ball games?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
I don't know...
Yes?
The DMZ?
You must be rich.
You know what you remind me of?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
What about the record?
Travis?
Just what?
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
How long has he been there?
Try holding the match like this.
Oh, are you all right?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
That's fine.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
For a fee.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Where.
Hello.
That ain't much of a name.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do they drug you?
Listen...
But that one night?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Why?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
Why should it be grounded?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Have you tried the telephone?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
There must be something...
There's porno theatres for that.
So whatja do now?
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Also clean.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Who?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Well, I just, you know...
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Motor oil?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
Mason.  Mason?
Hi.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Do you... remember me?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
You first.
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
They're not bad.
Your dancing's very good.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Delly, shhhhhh...
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes... yes, I do.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
No wallet, huh?
Yes.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
We've been closed for a while.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
Yes?
But I...
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
Jesus...
Did I what?
A few.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Evening, Luke.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
You should watch what you say.
Exactly.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
That was beautiful.
It's about me.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
That you got let go.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
I was wondering...
How do you like our little hamlet?
And what had you done?
I don't understand.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Mom, they're in a cage!
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Is smoking fun?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
What?
Do you know him?
See where I'm pointing?
See them two big trees across there?
And the white house?
I see. How do I get down there?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Of course.
The little girl's name.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
Gulls!
You did say birds?
Whose side are you on?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
When do you think they'll come?
Where will we go?
Mother, get a rope!
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Where's Mitch?
Then he saw.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Well, where did he go?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
No, of course not.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I don't know you.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
I didn't break that window!
So you're a lawyer.
Ouch!
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
We... we went to school together. College.
With... with Annie, of course.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
What did it say?
I'd still like to see you.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Are you all right?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Really? Tell me about it.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
What do you mean?
No, no...
The town looks clear.
How long have they been gathering there?
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Do you want to try your father again? 
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Yes, certainly. 
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
How do you plan to do that?
We need them.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
I fear he may have to.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
I'm cold as ice.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
But you did promise.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
See that, Fettes?
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
This is a gift.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
But why, Gray? Why?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
How long ago?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
She would if she could.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Two down. Two to go.
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Sssshhh. She's resting.
You lied at my trial.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
Fuck. Me.
I was a friend of your sister's.
You killed that cop Dutton.
No. You don't.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Erin!
You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Maybe a little demonstration.
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Tell me what?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
What does that mean?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Did all these people die in wars?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Go to the movies.
No foolin'? Will you?
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
You know about the United Nations?
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
It was a wonderful day.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Everyone seems so-- 
Oh -- hello--
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I want to know what he told you last night.
What happened?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Is it worth anything?
No -- no, thanks.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
I don't like horror comics.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Whattaya mean?
Death to all vampires!
Don't!  Stop!
Where you going?
Leave him alone.
You can't kill me, Star.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Still mad at me?
I'll hitch.
Okay?
Ocean air!
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
-- a job.
You're cute, Max.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
I am?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I'm Michael.
Ouch.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
I know, I've felt it...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
Huh?
Do I have to do this?
I'm making you a sandwich.
Michael?
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Who are you calling?
What do you want from us?
That night?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
You can't let anybody leave!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Childs!!
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.  Now...
You catch anything he was saying?
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Torch it over there!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Load of bullshit.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Hey, Sweden!!!
Would that test have worked?
I guess you're okay.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How many in their party?
Hey, man...!
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Looks good.
How long's it been?
Four!
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
What about Childs?
Get back!!
We should sleep in shifts.
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
Yes.  Just about here.
But you escaped.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
This has to end.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
Why would you let me go back?
Why?
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Admiration?  My my.
Dance with me...
Let's walk through the park...
Alex, what is it?
We took a walk three days ago.
Let them.
I was not.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
I've been working.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
Good night, then.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Kalen...
It was different then.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
"Eloi"?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
My father has gone to a better place.
My fowl have polluted the yard.
If I might explain, sir --
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
No, you're safe --
He's recovering on the third floor.
Relax.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
And what's that?
Yes.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
Did you know my father?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
But I like it I guess.
You're just gonna walk?
What for?
I think I can remember what's on them.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
But no one knew until after...
I don't believe a thing she just said.
I have no idea.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
What do you mean?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
And how do you know that?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
You know how to get there?
I tried to kill my wife.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Can you drive?
No.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
What's this?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Who do you think did it?
I've been better.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
Armed robber.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Stop.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise, is that you?
That sounds nice.
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Is that how you answer the phone?
Hello...
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
You're not touchin' that car.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
How do I look?
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
You think you've found your calling?
It won't work.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
What little dogs?
This is so beautiful.
What?!  What about him?!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Me too.  I feel awake.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
How far are we from Mexico?
Shit!
What?!  What d'you think?!
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
What in the hell is it?!
Now what?
We been seein' you all along the way.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
I'm not apologizing for shit!
We're fine!  How are you?
Yeah... sure did.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
No harm, no foul?
Gay? He said you were gay?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Well why don't you look her up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Mary.
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Healy you dog!
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Here, just have one of these then.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
How about -- ?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Mary ah, forget it.
Are you okay?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Any idea where I might start looking?
I don't buy it.
She's blackmailing you, right?
Four kids, three different guys.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Miami?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Thanks for picking me up.
I see where you're going.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
I can live with those reflections.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Meaning?
I don't watch the new ones.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Magda!
You don't think they're too big?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Oh, are you on the team?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Ted, are you okay?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
By the way, how's he doing?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
Well... why don't you move back?
So you're a writer?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Get out.
What what are you doing here?
Get over here.
Ho there.
Starshells.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
The other thing is...
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Jesus...
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Slow down. Smell that?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
John. How much time?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Hey, sport. You winning?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Let's get out of here.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
I don't want to listen to this again.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Hey.
I see.
A murder. On the reservation.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Who are you?
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Were you in Nam?
I did.
Couldn't sleep.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
So what?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Still after Jimmy?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
He's gone.
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
You take care.
X22. Read.
Ray...
What ya want?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
No way. No fuckin' way.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
I'll bet!
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I thought he'd never leave.
I beg your pardon.
You saw a MiG 21?
Yes, ma'am.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
There you go with those moves again.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
I'm different.
That's true. What are you?
No!
Does it bother you?
Come on.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Well no...inverse order.
...they say you're alright.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
What kind of games?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Looks like a tie.
Well?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Tomcats?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
That's missile lock!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Is there something I should know?
You're not supposed to...
So I've heard.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
I've lost him -- where is he?
We did it!
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we're next.
That's Kazanski.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
ON THE NOSE?
You saved our lives. You did it!
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Helping him in.
It was bad.
Yes sir..
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
Goose is dead.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Where's yours?
So, where to?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
What happened to number five?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What do you want?
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Kill him.
I'm with an very important client.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
What do you want?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Yeah.
What, aliens?
You're Kuato, right?
Shit!
They sell fake memories.
Yeah.
What are you, my father?
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
And you believe him?
Well...What do you say?
The hell you're not.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
No options.
I give up.
I'm not interested in that.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
...What?
This is too weird.
Don't be ridiculous.
I think you better leave.
I thought you didn't like me.
So you dropped by to apologize?
What reactor?!
What's wrong?
You guys all set?
How much you think?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Knock it off, Burt!
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
I might have an idea...
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
So long, cactus!
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Son of a bitch!
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Don't he have a home to go to?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
We playing cards tonight?
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
The con...!  Oh my God.
Darn it!
Think it's still following us?
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Oh really?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
-- What?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
Let's get a cab.
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
You do.
No. You tell me, Shu.
No.
...I'm dying out there.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
I followed you here from court.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
And why was an exception made?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
CIA?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No... No, go away.
No.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
The stuff we got last night.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Let's ditch this place and party.
We can do it right here.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
And no one found the ring?
That would indicate that it's the future.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
A blue rose.
I see. He does talk loud.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
Take a look at this.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
The usual, 9:15.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Call me.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Where are the Cookies?
Laura, I am your friend.
You're not mad at me?
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
But I love you, Laura.
Why do you do it, Laura?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Nice night.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Did you make me a tape?
We're on our way, Baby.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
When he finds out.
You'd think so.
You're getting warmer.
Can I take the car?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Dad.
Let me see.
Who was that?
No.
Are you sure you're okay?
Dad?
I always thought you knew it was me.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Leland...
Bobby didn't give you this?
When's the next business trip, big fella?
I don't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
What did he find?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
Yes.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Objection, we've...
Objection!
Mr. Concannon...?
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Thank you. When Debby...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
What is this going to cost?
Dr. Thompson...?
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
I am on the staff of...
She getting good care over there?
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Thank you.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Why?
Really. How wonderful for you.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
What happened...?
Not if you don't grow up...
I can't guarantee that...
Mr. Galvin's...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
Who are you protecting, then?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
Another, Frank...?
Well, well, well. Huh?
Uh...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Been a long time, huh...?
So what?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
That's right.
What the hell are you doing here?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Hey, how about that!
Hey, there - open up!
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
You seem to know a lot about him.
I do know him...slightly.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
The troops are certainly moving in here!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
Nothing there now.
They've blocked it!
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Colonel - shooting's no good!
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
What'll we say to 'em?
You mean that was a...
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Guess so.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Like Freddy.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Does he have to stay here over night?
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
These look quite fresh.
What?
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
In my bed.
Home.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
You didn't jump in.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Really?
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
The car's no there yet?
I'm sorry, I can't.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
That was Nancy, not me!
Now?
Did we lose anybody?
Looks like weather.
He would have loved this.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Everyone aboard young Bill?
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Well, that's all part of it.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
How old are you, son?
Make us proud.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Ninety-six.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
But that's not the point...
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
Where are you from any way?
Who told you that?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Uh, huh.
Can't do it.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
Son-of-a-bitch.
Immortality.
And being sixteen.
Me, too.
What?  Come on...
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
We've got a problem.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
About yourself?
It's outta here!
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
No, sir.
Swing up, son.
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
I can't be sure.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Need a hand?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Whattaya mean family?
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
So, it's back to the islands.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
The Good Witch...
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
What?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
In a fire, as I recall.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
Actin' funny how?
...are followin' him around.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
What's that, peanut?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
There's worse places, honey.
Trust me on it.
Oh God, Sailor.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Now what?
Sailor?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
He's the kind liked it.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Six.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Have it your way... But you want it.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Get rid of him?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
I know... I remember.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I just mean...
Trip??
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
Shit.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
You stay there.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Is he awake?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
So -- what do we do now?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Naturally you have copies.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
No...
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
I know.
Vernon.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Goodbye, Grady.
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Well...
So what are you doing out here?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
Yes.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
Who?
Isn't this...?
Humboldt County?
Colon cancer.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
When we fall, we fall hard.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
So, why did you take me up there?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
But, last night...
I'm sorry.
You coming?
Where you going?
I'm not going with them.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
Professor Tripp.
Easy there.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Is that Cristaile?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
And? Are you going to tell him?
Well...
Not have it.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Sara.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
And what did you say?
I'm through improvising.
I know.
Did you just make that up?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Listen, Antonia --
Who's this ?
What is it, Grady?
Excuse me?
Is it good?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
And?
Maybe I should read it.
Where you stand?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Are you riding with me, James?
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
Five years.
Hey, is that a school?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
One hundred and twenty feet.
Annette? She's good... tense.
I'm working on it.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Ah, come on.
Soon.
What do you mean?
There's a million birds here.
I don't like starlings.
It's just a city park.
I'd love to hear it.
I have to go.
I haven't broken any laws.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Do you believe in them?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
The passionate one?
Are you taking your medication?
I'm twelve.
What?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
But will he... ?
You should go home.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I don't understand.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
You don't like coming here, do you?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How long is this going to take?
I mean, when will I be normal.
How do they know?
Go home, Walter.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Sorry.  Where is she?
Don't ever do that again.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
I'm only asking questions.
Did you get an erection?
It's going to take time, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
Is that a school?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
No you're not.
Tell me about it.
Is that all?
Hey, there.
So, what did you do?
You're not joking.
Look, you can go now.
I never hurt them. Never.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
I've changed.
They seduce you?
Are you serious?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
It's a bad idea.
I don't need a plant.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Nice shot, Lins.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Lord Almighty.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
Fine.  Be that way.
What about O-2?
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
He's jammed the mechanism.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You see where it's coming in?
Alright, put this on.
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Hello, Brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.
What's the matter with you?
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
That's Perry.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
You better not say you missed that.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Hippy, you pussy.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Hey!
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
How are you?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
But how could you say such a thing?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Somebody must live here!
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
What is it, Claudia?
Does it please you to say such things?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Good night, my love.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
But where did you finally end up?
It's divine!
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Yes, sir. Three times.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Thank you.
Whose boat is that?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Your mother?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Zuria?
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
No.
I can't say.
She'd punish me.
No.
I'm a blimp.
Because...
It's a sin to be fat.
But she watches... she listens.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
Should you see a doctor?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Well, who in particular?
Something I ate.
Yes.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Do you have any children?
Do you know a Marie?
You liked Sister Paul?
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you believe she really saw them?
What did you do?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
How did you have a baby?
Did you want it to come out?
Why were you afraid?
Would you like to tell me?
Yes.
Which one?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Do you remember what just happened?
She said Michael.
So I could go to him.
She'd seen him too.
No...
I hate him...
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Something they... that they overlooked.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have it.
No, no, no...
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
You can call me Sister.
Could there have been anyone else?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
This was before her pregnancy?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
She has it now.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
You hate us don't you?
What?
How?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Your niece!
Do you know what she did to her?
Because I am a moral person.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Pipe!
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think they ever existed?
But how did it happen?
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
You went to the room to help with the birth.
And the baby.
Well --
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Oh, it's all right.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Can you fix him for me?
Sure.
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Grotty?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Gerron.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Sorry.
Oh!
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
Aye, I knew you were.
What are you?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Yes.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
A book!
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
What are you doing there?
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Let's go and muck in.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
What's old got to do with it?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Now get on with it.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Hello.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Yeah, you want to watch it.
He's been gone a long time.
Paul's grandfather.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
How's that?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
I'll set John on you!
I feel like shit...
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
I don't recognize that constellation.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Activate lifter quads.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
Can we come up?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
I have recorded the transmission.
Well, get started.
<u>He</u> died.
Why, what's wrong?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Dead!
What the hell's going on?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Hey now, what is this?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Now we're in for it.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
Now what's wrong?
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
What common objects?
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
What'd he say?
It's stopped?
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
How?
And what do we do when we find it?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Let's hear it.
But?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
We won't need it then.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Two down, four to go.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
That'll blow the ship up.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Headache?  Dehydration?
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
What do you need?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Give or take.
Where is she?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
Where're they headed?
When?
What's going on?
It's too late!
Oh, man...
Deal.
Listen to what?
Whoa, wait a minute...
But I'm going first...
Hold it, hold it...
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
They knocked out the external feeds.
Okay, I'm out of here!
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Six month stint on Datus.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
Think I spoke too soon...
And what is your name?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
You're more than modest.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
Just like it.
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
We're?
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
I can't believe my ears...
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
She was a liar, she was a liar!
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Feeling better, my dear?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Just slipped your mind.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
In time she'll be what you are.
Right here. A minute ago.
Good luck, genius...
Nothing?
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Knit me a muffler.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Happy birthday, darling...
Okay.
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
I wish it were.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Never try to outguess Margo.
With the paper to prove it.
Just wondered what?
Why what?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
Ah...
You think?
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
You need new girdles.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Why not?
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
That's the door.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Mrs. Richards.
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
You won't forget it?
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
Oh, but there is-
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
Congratulations, Eve.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
How'd hear about it?
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
No, don't go...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Right here.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
She's just outside the door.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo, really...
What about Bill?
He's in love with you.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
I remember.
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
What's so funny?
Who is it? What's it all about?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
How about calling it a night?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
She's your understudy.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
I don't think I could be.
Hello..
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
Play it again.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
"Liebestraum."
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
When's the audition?
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
--it was fine the way it was--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
Carl?
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
What's that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
And?--And?--
Were you eyebrow reading?
Anything you've got.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
We understand your problem--
How do you want to handle Sloan?
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--we gotta top the Times--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
Morning or night?
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Sure--off the record.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
I thought you had to get to Miami.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
So tell me about the Times article.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Who by?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
I really can't talk now--
What's this?
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
--what do you think?--
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Talk about Segretti--
How grand?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Your name, please.
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Where?
Are you sure?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
That was awhile ago.
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
No, it was good.
I'll do it.
Good work, Ostreicher.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Just go!
Not bad, Chris.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Um...Chris --
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
You're missing the game for us?!
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
Like a bet?
Did I miss anything?!
That's stupid.
Hey, minuteman.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Yes.  Seriously.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
...excuse me?!
This'll do.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
You guys got the Latin homework?
This was remade?  Into what?
Who cares?
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Jim...
Oh, Kev.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
That's my trick!
About the other day...I've been thinking.
You comfortable?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Kevin, it was just a --
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
That junior chick?
Bullshit.  From where?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Sure. I can follow that.
Like an underground club?
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
What makes you so sure this will work?
I don't know...
Are you crazy!?
What the fuck!? You too!?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
I know where he'll go.
No wonder he let her go.
God. I can't believe it.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Pull over! Now!
Claude...?
What's the problem?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Not you too -
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Because Gaston was after it.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Where is it! Please!
Claude.
What do you mean, maniacs?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Why would he pick this one?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
What did she say?
Well?
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Are you running away?
Who did you hear it from?
Did I tell you that?
Poor Meetoo!
By pulling my hair?!
Come on up!
What a beautiful ship!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Don't let me go!
Who are you, child?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Hurry up with those papers.
See? The Princess is under there ...
The "Odessa Dunk"?
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
You are the boy ...
She does.
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Who's on television?
Singer!
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
What do you mean, next?
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Allison.
Lyndon Johnson?
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Uh, narcolepsy.
Fifteen years, huh?
I know.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Really, do you think so, really?
Hey, listen, listen.
Gimme a kiss.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
We can digest our-
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
H'm?
No.  You're a wreck.
No.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Look at these guys.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
You see, like you and I...
Yeah, I know it's small.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Uh-uh-why?
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
I'm home!
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
I'm following you and David, if you-
What's- It's me, open up.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Yeah, this place is great.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Alvy.
This is my room.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
What-
I can think of another word.
Who said that?
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Oh.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Ah.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Oh.
You wanna lie down?
You like this house, Max?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Oh. What about?
Yeah.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
So who won?
What's that?
It's going.  It's going.
She's a constant surprise.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Why didn't you bring him?
Well, probably.
I'll change back before we leave.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Let's get the kids.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah...
Go.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
You're out of your mind.
I mean, you're really back.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
You want me to uninvite her?
Otis!  No barking!
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Truce.
She left the fucking gate open.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
No.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
I know.
Has she called?
Coffee?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Yes, she is.
No.
Don't I find what?
Joking.
Do I put you off?
The infamous dog?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
I'm a little nervous, so...
And Ryan works at home.
I've never done this before.
Ryan's really angry with me.
Medallions.
Yes.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
Of course it's alright.
Jesus Christ.
Ryan.
Well, yes, actually.
Ready to go?
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Ryan!
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
I so wish I'd known.
I'm so sorry.
The Shostakovich.
Would you, like, marry him?
How?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Everyday.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Thank you, Panes.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Enough about me.
He's a novelist.
She's such a great photographer.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Well good.  Thank God.
What do you mean, thank God?
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
I don't have a drug problem.
Break's over.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
General -- we have to talk sometime!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You're right!
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
You dance...
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Water...water...
We're going to die!
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Z!  what are you doing?
Of course --
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
You new, kid?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Not that one.  Or that one.
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
What do you see out there?
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Ma'am?
What did I tell you?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
That makes me feel just terrible.
Twenty-seven.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
What is it?
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Who?
When are you coming home?
Something wrong with your legs?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Too slow?
Who was that?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
Thank you.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
I know so. He's a taker.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
I never thought he'd do it.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
The Vice Squad?
Who?
How would you like to go tonight?
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Well -- I guess so.
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Now you're being bright?
Now hold on, Baxter --
No, no -- just had a little accident.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
You threatening me?
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
She going to be all right, Doc?
Want to tell me what happened?
What's her name?
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
Any of that coffee left?
Help yourself.
How's the patient?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Who is Mickey?
Family?
Say, this is Snugsville.
Not so rough, honey.
Good night?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Kubelik.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Yes, I know.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
How long has it been -- a month?
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I have that date -- remember?
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Now, Fran --
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
What !
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
We've been attacked.
Which part is that ?
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
So what happened ?
Why they call you that?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
What do you see?
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Well, get in there.
They're not Cong.
I --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
Anybody see some smoke ?
What cat  ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
What does that mean ?
Terminate ?
Spooky.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Can you trust them?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
You were not coming here, to see me?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
The other one --
What?
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Who are you?
Cognac?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
That's 27, sir.
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
30   CONTINUED:
134  CONTINUED:
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
...I won't let a killer walk!
165  CONTINUED:  
26   CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
I'll go into town with you.
Did you catch Corbett?
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Ben Corbett?
Desmond.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Does he have people?
Stay put!
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Can you walk?
All this for laying traps on private land?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I need to rent a cabin.
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
Meaning he'll need a plane.
There's what they're waiting on!
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Me. My home number is on this card.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
So. Anything else?
Nice of you... thank you.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Thanks, Melvin.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
What job?
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Can you not be violent?
Uh-huh...
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
But what about...
One night with me!
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
No touch. No touch. No touch.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
Good evening.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
That's very thoughtful.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
I told you to go on in.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Did you like it that much?
Picking on me won't help.
But you know where you're lucky?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Is there a problem?
Why?  What happened?
No shit.
Yeah.
Okay.
What are you doing?
What does that fucking mean?
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Who?
Hello, Robert.
Nikita?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
I don't need the money.
How?
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
My first take?
No.  Just the first one.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
About?
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
I told you, he will.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
What did he want?
Was that it?
Do you have ulcers?
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Can I ask you something?
Attraction is a complication?
What happened to her?
Martin.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I wasn't watching television.
I prefer it like this.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
How much farther?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
This will take some time.
Cheers Katka!
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Like Custer huh?
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I'm an idiot?
I've been saying that since we met.
It must be on the other side of this.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Close!
We're going to need it all.
Let's split.
Afternoon!
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
No, We aren't going to do it.
My God! What happened?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Now you're using that word.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
What do you want me to do?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
Yeah, no problem.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Turned Czech huh?
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
I don't want to get in trouble.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Forget about me Kat.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Will they free me?
Will this thing take long?
I thought I'd help out.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Seems a shame!
Why are you doing all this, what for?
What would you like, beer?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Who you saving the dishes for?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
You will wish you hadn't.
And the students?
Sure!
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
I think we should be going honey.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Come on Holly!
It's more than what you're worth.
You are responsible...What has happened?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
Out with Belinda?
You saw him?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
What the -- ?!
I know. Don't say anything.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
What does that mean?!
Hey.
She great or what?
Your turn.
Excuse me?
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
When did you build this?
So what do you want to see?
Ergo?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
What are you going to -- ?
What are you thinking?
It's gone now.
But if you could, you would?
By accident --
This week.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
Landon. You go on home.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You have materials for the side bearings?
I thought she built it herself.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
So what did we just make?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Learn anything?
You remember me...?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
What time does school start around here?
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
What do I say?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
And where am I gonna be?
Your line, George!
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Professor? Professor Brown?
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Where did you get this?
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
That's all taken care of.
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Oh yeah?
Where'd you get them antlers?
You ever held another job before?
Oh yeah?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Well, Kit...
Good luck to you.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Hi.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Nothing.
My stomach's growling.
Is that all there is to it?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
I came in the front.
Why?
Look at all this junk.
You tired?
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Course it's too bad about your dad.
This your place?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Yes.
Who are you?
Think I'll take the juice?
You tossed my hat out the window.
What crate?
Apache?
We will, old fried, we will.
Anybody we know?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
The girl I remind you of.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
If you could, I'd Â
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Well I have to come up with Â an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
How d'ya like your room!
I write.
How long you been up there, Fink?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
I beg your pardon?
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Wuddya got for me Â what the hell happened to your face?
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
Well, I'm... glad to hear that Â
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself Â
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
...Your room does that too?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
...Can I come in?
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Jesus... They can tell that...
...I just don't know what... to doÂ
You'll be back?
...Where did we put him?
Yeah... rye whiskey?
Mr. Lipnik, I Â
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider Â
Fink.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Yes sir.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
...Those your only bags?
What did... What did he Â
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
All night?
Yeah, I was drinking.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
Take care, you hear?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
How are you, Nick?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
We were in some of the same classes.
I need a cigarette.
Who?
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
I had him in two classes.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Why did you change your name?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I told you -- I quit.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
But you didn't hurt --
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
I didn't.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
What did you pay Nilsen?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
You won't believe me.
Can I talk to you a minute?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
What do we do now, Nick?
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Nope, can't say that I do.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I'm not afraid of her.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Where the hell you goin'?
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
Who are you?
How old was she when this happened?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
What do you think?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Naa..
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Of what?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
It's in New York.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Ouch..
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I'm not black.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
What're you doing? You're doing something.
We got beat.
What's the rush, John Henry?
Good.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
She's good.
... What's the matter?
Some of them.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it Â did your girlfriend leave you?
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
That one's for you.
You don't have any!!!
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
I'm listed.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
You buy this "blurry" business?
Ten, nine...
Working late?  I'm touched.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
You certainly will not.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
This is easy.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
How did you...?
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
No!?
You're not even listening to me.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Actually, he took the car.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
How are you feeling, young man?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
What do maniacs always want?
How about, MR. E.
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
Up here, Al.
Why's that?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Now black rubber.
We'll talk some other -
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
What do you know about obsession?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Fast work. You just moved here.
He sure did.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
A-14.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Please.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
What is that?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Do you sail?
No.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
My brother's a priest, man.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
... Thank you.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Yum, yum.
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Are they paying you for all this?
Alexander... I know you.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
It's the last thing we need.
Hi,
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
0 my god.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Oh yes.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Howls he getting on with the family?
And howls Alison?
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
You're not going to ....
No!
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Maybe two cars.
Welsh again.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
What's gone?
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Ow! These chips suck.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Turd-burglar...
Beavis.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
...Two...
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Do her? Huh huh.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
She's ready.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
Maybe this is heaven.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
Here's something.
She's only fourteen...
Honey.  Let's go.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
What...?
What time is it?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Aren't you dead?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
Handbook?  When...?
Just get some people out of our house.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I want to be dead too.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Beetle!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
So... You're ready for me now?
Can you help <u>me</u>?
W... What is it?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Otho'll know what to do.
What?
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
They're... not here anymore.
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
What's happening to them?
They don't want to come down.
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
I would like to walk today.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
Do you know Raphael?
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
I hope you're comfortable.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
... Good night, Chauncey.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Yes.
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
... Are you sure you like it?
I see.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Evening, Chance.
Good morning, Louise.
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
... How long have you been living here?
Since you were a child?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
1952...?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Correct.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
... Ben, really...
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This is not what I requested.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Morning.
Is the trial date set?
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Yeah, just an idea I had.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
So how was it? What was he doing?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I know.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
So how was it?
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Money, Miss Warts?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Security.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Yes, well...
IÂm not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
Tickets to Malkovich?
You wanted to be partners with me?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
I've fallen in love.
You're glowing again.
Lotte? Is that you?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
No.
Vegas? What'd you think?
Impressions? Those are hard.
The Great Mantini?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Yes, my dear?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
No! Don't harm the vessel!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
When?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
We have to meet.
Yeah, I saw them
How do we do that?
What's the play?
Who's calling?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Come on in.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Vegas.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
That girl...You know, Beloved...
She gone like they say?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
No. I mean work work.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Should I wake her?
She likes to see you off in the morning.
But mama..
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
You planning to do anything about it?
You remember your price, Stamp?
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Hiya Allan.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Her life is in your hands.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
I know my rights.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
NUSSING!
Excuse me?
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
What--
I am the Walrus.
Burkhalter.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Am I wrong?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
I've had a--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Yes, heh--
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Howdy do, Dude.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Oh, no.
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Well--sure, I could do that--
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
That's really thoughtful but I--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
She most certainly was not!
And please don't call her my mother.
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well yeah...I know that.
Jeffrey.
Finder's fee?
Jeffrey--
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Well...no, of course not--
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
No, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Theodore Herzel.
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Have it your way.  The point is--
The fucking point is--
The what?
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Thanks Walter.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
No.
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
Shit yeah!
This driveway.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
It's a heart attack.
What about that shit about Vietnam!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Dude here.
Dude here.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Fuckin' A.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Well?  Aren't you?
You monsters!
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Bullshit. Walter!
You come all the way down here to roust--
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
How do you feel?
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Put it back in park, Blade.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
Nomak?
From his father, of course.
Any casualties?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Stupidity.
What took you so long?
Going somewhere?
You're not going anywhere.
No longer.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
What am I injecting you with?
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
You care about him, don't you?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
No --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
How many of you are there?
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
What happened to her, where did she go?
No.
What're you doing there?
Inside the grave?
No!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
--how old?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
Druid Hill Park.
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Your body, your call.
--now c'mon!
Nothing. I dunno--
Just...try and go back to sleep.
What'd you dream?
I want to see something!
Are you marked like this??
Absolutely.
--hours before--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
I don't think it was them.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
This is a little nuts.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
I don't believe this.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What I never could figure about the movie?
We should be so lucky.
What about night?
Where <u>is</u> it?
Fire escape??
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Cotter?
Yeah. Me too.
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
Hold this.
What're you doing?
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Just let it go, I've got you!
What's that?
Jesus.
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
I should check on Anna.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--yes--
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
...Drive me to a motel?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Ray?
...What?
...You called me this morning.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...That's what's important.
...Who?
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
...What was that back there?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
If the pay's right I'll do it.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...What?
Yeah...
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...it's too damn risky.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Howdy stranger.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Why do you do it?
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Who knows you have these?
Frank gone?
Bull.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
THEN WHAT?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Don?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
You don't?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Hi. can I come in?
Falling.
Come in.
Yes. Frank-
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
Are you a bad boy?
You like to open me. don't you?
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
I guess I should go.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
I don't want to go.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Did you see her undressed?
Okay. be careful.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay.
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
... Sandy?.
Hi Dad.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
I'm going out for awhile.
No.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
On the plane.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Que va hacer?
Blanca, por favor.
This is it for me.
This is it for me.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Mirtha.
What can I do for you guys?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
What the fuck is that?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
What the fuck is that?
Goodness.
I don't think so.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
You?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
Twenty-six months.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
No, my brother.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Diego?  It's George.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
Please, continue.
What's the matter, George?
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Yeah, layaway.
Mexico.
It's a family heirloom.
Layaway shmayaway.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
Freedom.
Keep them coming.
Money.
I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Tell Mom, you know...
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
George.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
I don't know.
Well, here I am.  See?
What?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
I swear.  On my life.
I didn't mean to...
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
It's not enough.
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
No shit, Kevin?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Second name.
You afraid of these ...?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Read it.
Where's Kader?
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Take some time off.
An inquiry into what?
What about the will?
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
What did they argue about?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
You've been following me?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Why did you come by?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Is it Marsh?
She was here?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Why not?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Did you ever see her again after that?
What did she say?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
Where did you meet him?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes.
Three fifteen.
Yes.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Frank!
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
How?
Why not?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
This is your house.
Why not?
Hi, Frank.
Yes -- she did.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
Yes -- it would be nice.
Alone?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
Hello?
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Humped
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
What's he saying now?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Then why do you?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Carolyn!
Madge?
Roseman Bridge?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
This time of year.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
And how long are you here for?
About a year and a half.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
When?
Francesca?
Are you all right?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
My mistake. I apologize.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Okay. See you later.
Yeah?
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Can I help?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
What were you like when you were younger?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
I... What do you want?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
What do you want me to say?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
I don't know. Please...
'Bout 4:30.
Want anything special for dinner?
Franny?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
It clearly states in the will --
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
You want us to move in here?
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
That's what?
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Jimmy, you've got --
Aren't you going to join us?
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
It's alright, baby.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
How do you know?
And you believe her?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
We gotta jump!
You got the cash?
What are we doing down here?
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
We just thought...
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
The next one blows off your dick.
Caesar!
Sit down, Gino!
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's impossible!
Got to think this through ...
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
I need you ...
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Shut up, Violet.
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
You're helping Rajeev?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
You got the key?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
Who?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Are they really?
A beer?
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
...  I needed that.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
We're not that different, Corky.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I don't.
Yes.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
Then what?  Exactly.
It's in a case, on his desk.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Why?
Gino Marzzone.
What happened?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Why?
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
What if he doesn't run?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
I won't ask again.
What do you mean?
I think so.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Paris?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I need a ride out of here.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
We're about an hour away.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
What is that?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
Yes.
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
What?
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
... And then some.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Gillian Layton?
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
What's the matter?
Remember how they used to stick out?
Jack!!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
So what are you going to do about her?
They weren't at school with us.
Take her off the list.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Jack, she's innocent!
Yes we have, Jack!
You stupid bastard!
How could you do this to me?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Are you alright?
Who are you? Let go!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Where are you taking me?
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
We've got both.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I was right! Step on it!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
That's it.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
You want to take my console into your office?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Sod it, it's broken!
Hey - that's my desk!
Lime, I need to use your computer
How long will she he away?
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
What were we saying?
What have you done with his body?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
This is an emergency!
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Are we?
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
No, no, that's impossible.
Is she dying?
You know each other a long time?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Okay, what happened?
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Yes?
He's better, isn't he?
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Sleeping.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Backup?
I hate vodka.
He got better.
What do you think?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Where's Burke?
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
You okay?
Whadda we bring?
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's get in a fight, then.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
He's crazy.
You're in the stomach!
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
What did I do to you?
How <u>you</u> doing?
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
You know what I...
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
He excels at gratitude.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Yes.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
Do you feel good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
How?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Let's go...
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Do it then.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Just when do you start, telling people?
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
Jane?
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Play back the last line...
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
How do I get out of here?
No...no.
I really have to go.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Anchor?
You don't have to finish tonight.
Why so glum?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
I had no idea she was this good.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
You okay?
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
No.  Were you going to you?
So you like me, huh?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
No.  Did he really?
What?
I don't wan to discuss work.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
Tonight.
I'm almost ready -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Did you hear what he said?
It's true, isn't it?
I mean, you look so pretty.
Nice night out...
I like you very much, Walter.
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
That's word for word.
It was.
Maybe so...
What's the matter with you?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
You know what that proves?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
What do you have in the box?
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
I also saw the girl give you this.
Police officer.
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
I don't think so Mayolia.
You don't have to do anything!
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Oh, OK.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
It's coffee.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Which way did she go?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Dying.
He doesn't look fifty.
Buffy, honey?
Something like that.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
Hey there.
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
I am a God!  A God!
Where are you gonna go?
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Why'd you come back?
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
Dress, huh?  What for?
He did what he was supposed to.
Leave me alone.
That's me.
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Like what?
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
All right.  What do we do now?
Meet me at this address after school.
What?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Here?
Put your head back.
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Watchers?
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
There isn't time.
All right.
Football is my life.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
No THX.
I haven't seen him tonight.
You think so?
Buffy?
I can't believe they still ate it.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Buffy!
Buffy, the ape-woman.
I really was way way too too.
Oh, thank you very much.
Except for Prom.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
How was that?
I'll tuck you in.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
Neither will I.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
I got released.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
Settle what?
Why am I a fuck?
You're a great catcher.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Eight and twenty-four.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
...been right, but who knows?
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
Now this is just a signature card.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
In other words, I'm fucked.
...very difficult to get in.
Hey, Ace.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
My wife?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Listen, I would -
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
What - what, Caesar's?
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Ginger called me.
She was afraid to call you.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Hello.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
...and she doesn't always -
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Why not make them happy?
Now, he's really pissed.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Hello.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
...under?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Get off of me! Stop it!
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
Oscar wants you to call him.
To the Riviera.
Hi, Sam.
Oh...
I want you to let me go.
I wouldn't -
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
...worst possible time for me.
No.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Yeah.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You gotta go back out there.
Yeah, that works out.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Fucker!
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Artie!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
Hey, Frankie.
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Hi, Jennifer.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
He gives a fuck what I do?
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Let me think about that.
You know?
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
Yes, you did.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Come on.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Yes.
I'm here.
Do you know that?
...all the luck in the world.
Right.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
They checked in alone.
Yes, don't worry.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Hey, how you doin'? 
Wow.
Incredible.
Well, how come I laid nine?
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
You walk past me?
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
He's here.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
How you doin'?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Since when do you talk like that?
I know, but that's enough.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Hi.
Yes, uh...
Have we reached the epi-center?
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
I better go report this in...
You're kidding.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Pass!
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
Next time, call...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Don't sneak up on me...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Nice breasts.
Any place.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Are you guys all right?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
He's seen both of us now.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
And what're you whispering for?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Don't lay this on me!
The cops could trace this call back to you.
I'm with two friends now.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
26th off Wilshire.
Tell me what she looks like.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Did you hear that click?
God, if he doesn't come back --
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Can you walk?
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
You, I would've noticed.
You were at the Emerald that night?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
What's Nels' number?
What's happening?
Think you could do a picture of me?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
What's your point?
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Who are you working for?
You're making it too easy.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
Where do we meet?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Negative.
And not a nickel.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Stop the crying.
Seems like it.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
I can see the benefit in that.
Where's the backpack?
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Seems not.
I already called for an ambulance.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He's back, Col
You see that, Col?
Fuck off, Dave.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
No.
And what's it like?
Everybody wants something.
Perform?
You on the game?
What's that about?
Why?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
No --
What would he think?
What does that mean?
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
So I'm sorry.
Will you meet me again?
Do they know?
Don't.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Don't.
Shouldn't be, Dil
You'd do anything for me?
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
You like me better like this.
Why?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
So tell me.
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Your soldier.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Yes.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Promise?
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Lucky you.
What was it?
See does he want some.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Eddie and Tinker died.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
So you did fuck up.
She's nobody. She likes me.
And what if I say no?
You sure?
So he knows your name?
Back in a minute, Jody
Yes.
I thought it was Dave.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Who is he?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
No?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
Can't. Once I signed up.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
See? I was right about you.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Nothing.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
I said you bastard -- stop --
The teddy bear?
I said shut the fuck up --
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Oh!
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
Where's that airlines bag?
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
Then say it.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Why not?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
No, what?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Steal it how?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
That's the spirit.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Yes -- ?
No.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
No.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Starting with his own.
But you're -- divorced?
What now?
Sorry about that.
Very pretty. Now what?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Your --
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
You can't.
Whitefoot, of course.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
I'm not fifteen.
Who told you to do that?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
The phone's ringing --
Or Tex?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Hm?
Got you.
Reggie -- open the door.
What are you doing?
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Forty-five thousand.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I was, too.
VoilĹ what?
Up there! It is up there!
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
How's that?
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Good for you.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
I'm still having trouble with English.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
I wasn't --
We're here.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Stop that!
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Who is it from?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Yeah? What's that?
Why?
You do?
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
Hi Jody.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
is there anything you do?
You were eavesdropping.
No!
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Should we close down any eruption?
Well?
Did you warn her?
St. Michael's.
Of what?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No.
No, you couldn't.
Why?
I know where you're going.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Then you should go.
Me? Why me?
_ Your father raped someone?
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
You heard about that?
Don't you think it's sick?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I got to get home.
Are you O.K.?
They're not picking me up until six.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Are you coming to the party?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
Jody. Wait.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Yes.
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Yes?
What are you doing?
You can have both if you want.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Stacy?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
At least somebody likes this shit.
It's a damn postal truck!
A little early for a delivery.
Where's Sam?
Huh?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
All right.
All right, then how about this?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog ain't mean.
...up.

No cell.
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
...-damn!
Shut up.
...work!  It's not even load-...
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
    Elvis is on ice again.
 Nice job back there.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...-er!
...let live.
I did not steal the truck.
Holy shit...
...up!
Oh, shit.
...Shift.
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
That's right.  Now,  move!

 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Come on, old Pete.
...easy, easy, easy.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Whoo!
Ho, ho...
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
No.  Shit.

Yeah...
 Aw, shit  

You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!

This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
How wonderful for you.
Listen, Arlo...
...shit.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...

Ow!  
They're movin'.
Yeah.


...to him. 
Whoo!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Mason.
Come on.  Come on.
...-ta get outta here!
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
They'll meet you at the top.
Who put the big hurt on...
You, Arlo.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Patriotism is its own reward.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
I urge you to be persuasive.

It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.

Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Doc-...
...-lar.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
"I am become Death, the...
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...about--
No, go--
You look fit...healthy...
Mm-hm.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Do you know what'll...
Good to see you again, Leo.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Of which we have more than enough.
Hit him again.

What about these two?
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
I don't see my container.
...and unharmed, de-...

No.
Hit it...
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
 ...that tunnel.
That little geek is my...
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...is a perfect hunter.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And what if it does?
...-m-means, Mason.  
Yeah, I just....
And only then does our noble friend realize...
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...beer.
...to talk, son.
Let me see your...
What the hell was that?
  All right.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Get in 



 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
It's too late, Mason. I've...
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
An honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Sir?
Always?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Very.
Why is that funny?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
What does this mean?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
What are you talking about?
What's that, Curly?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Sure thing.
Yes.
Where did you get this material?
Looking for someone.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
What are you doing here?
Isn't that your number?
Absolutely.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
What's the maid's address?
Well, let's go.
Give you three minutes.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
No.
No.
You and your husband never discussed her?
Iced tea.
I should talk this over with your husband.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You left your keys in the ignition.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Mr. Gittes.
K... Cross.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Know him?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
...No. Why was it.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
I know.
Do? To who?
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Upstairs. Why?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
...where does Kyo live?
How do you know?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Oh my goodness.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Do you know me?
Have we ever met?
Never?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
The water.
Come again?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
How did they get it away from him?
What about?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
So he says you sent them?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
Course, she settled down nicely.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
What are you doing here?
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
You understand now? You see it clearly?
You're still beautiful...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
How long's it been shut?
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Sixty-two thousand -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
And the notice?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
Emily!
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
Oh!!
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
What's funny now?
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
I won't let you go.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Close the door, Raymond.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yeah, all in crates.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Are you sure?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
Thanks. Have a good one.
Excuse me, but...
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
I think you'd better leave now.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
So where is he?
You're kidding.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Train. It took eight hours.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
It's not what you think.
Was I right?
I'm giving him his ring back.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
He's not invited.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Pack of cigarettes.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You only brought one ball?!
That's what I said.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Five years.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Great story, isn't it?
It takes different strokes to move the world.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
I'm talking to myself here.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
I guess.
Yeah.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
She's in here?
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Thirty-seven!
Why'd you apologize?
Design major.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Why not?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Stop it.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Her fucking body fell out!
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Jesus!
Then how come you got the fine?
You're kidding.
Hey, what about Veronica?
You're a snake.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Make them change.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You know him?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Oh for God's sake!
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
Be careful.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Why did you agree to come in then?
You're trusting.
"Be there?"
How many girls have you slept with?
No; who were the three, besides me?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
Really?  You're the best.
You had to tell him.
What did he say?
A couple...?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
What are you talking about?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
What did he say?
What part of Russia?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Dental School.
Willam!
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
C-4?
Hal's signalling he's OK.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Surprise me.
A monkey?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Where are you, Walker?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
The money!
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
What the hell are you doing here?!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
I'm going with you.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
How're ya feeling?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
He knows it well.
You can stop right there.
I know...
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
A flare up...
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
And I can't leave.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
What if he can't?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
We might be able to go that way.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
Take the rope.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Travers, you're not running things.
Have her come up.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Oh, my God!
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Why didn't you send the money over?
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Been punished, yeah?
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
So this is the young man?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
What would you like to know, sir?
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
It's alright, thank you.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
What crime did you commit.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Thank you, sir.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Surprise?
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Yes sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Brown hair, is it?
Blue eyes?
Are you an Epileptic?
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Something like that.
How are you feeling today?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Yes?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Carry on, Chief.
Pitiful rookerful...
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Like what?
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
This your current address?
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
No.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I picked up a tail.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Something going on?
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
What are you gonna do?
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
I was with Max when he got the call.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
Hi, Ma.
I'm standing right here.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
You prefer nights?
Like what?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
Good.  Help me out here.
Max.
Try some deep breathing.
You better?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Please.  Don't do anything.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
What you mean, no?
Show up for what?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
Who's Heller?
Head towards Union Station.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
And you believe me...?
As in...? 
Well.  That was brilliant.
Are you crazy?!
I better get going.
You saved my life.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Please put it down.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
What is it?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
What about them?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Then tell me what happened.
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Geronimo is down.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Liza Sutton is dead.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
You made your decision yet?
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
<u>Why you</u>?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
A dog.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Do you believe me?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
That you come with me.
What?
There's no plug to pull.
Is it possible...?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
What in the hell...?
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Talk to him.
Could we hear to China?
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
So who -- what -- are you?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
No more stalling, Captain.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
Hokkaido Island.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
The V.L.A.?
Greenbank?
But what about your research -- ?
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
How do you mean?
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Do you love your parents?
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
So.  The final countdown.
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
No.
Tell us about it.
Please! Please!
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You can't do that!
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
So then you just call him.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Luke. Where you goin?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Cuter again.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Back a buck.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
He'll never make it.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
What?  What'd I do?
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
We'll get the paramedics...
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
Yes.  Without question.
I thought he was lying.
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
She's supposed to have it.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
We've got another one.
But it's a different m.o.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What's that siren?
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
Who's the married man?
Tell me what to do!
It's a woman shot in a car?
Just get out of your vehicle...
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
It's none of my business anymore...
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Answer it.
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Absolutely.
You messed with the scene.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
There was no sperm.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
So what have we got?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
Detective Niccoletti?
He's not treating her right...
We were together six years, sir!
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
Not a lot of action here.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Isn't that rather too close...?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Are we allowed to park here?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
You're kidding.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
Do we have to talk about this?
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
Just go ahead and tell us.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
What about this one?
How can I help?
It'll be fine.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
You're slowing.
Will you get time off to do that?
Are you sure, Dear?
Tell us every detail.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
I haven't had a crush since I was
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Must you walk so quickly?
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Letty, you should be in bed.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
A while, I guess.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
But you're checking it out.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
He asked me to marry him.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess.
No.
We'll get caught.
A daisy for the lady.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
I wish I could have seen that.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
What else would you do?
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Furnished?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
Wow.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Good luck.
Promise?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
What?
Silly, silly, silly.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
What are we going to do?
Can I put these here for tonight?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
You don't have a fever.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Are you all right?
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
No, you've done a perfect job.
So will you?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
Agent Hadley.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
They left about a half hour ago.
Hello?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
No.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Hello?
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
-- Super what?
Uh, no --
But you were there?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
Tonight?
I don't know.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Because you're the closest.
Hopefully no one.
I'm going to kill him myself!
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We still have to get out of here.
Hello?
Don't bullshit me.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Maybe you should call the police.
I just thought that--
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
They don't have a wine list.
No, I didn't.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
Going somewhere?
You guys used to work together?
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
Holy shit.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You ever hear of jet lag?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
Can't sleep?
What are you doing?
Why?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
I don't care about your sword.
You're home late... or should I say early?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Put them down.
Do you know her?
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
You're not married, are you?
About you and Li Mu Bai?
No, really?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Here you must be in proper attire.
You, sister...
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
You shouldn't have come.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
No.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
It's Jade Fox!
They're gone.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Talent. Hi.
No onions though, okay?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
Mom --?
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
You look like a rock star without a job.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
Well, how's your friend?
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
I wish to possess what you have now.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
What the hell are you?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Don't waste my time.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Thank you.
Nothing.
What do you mean?
You promise not to say anything?
So what year are you going into?
Got a boyfriend back home?
Why not?
You a lesbo?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Oh really?
How do you know I've been with several women?
You need help.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Shut up.
It was fine.
And that's a bad thing?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Sure. Have a good night.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
You know what? I don't take it back.
You really want to know?
Good for you.
Please don't go.
Hi.
The football stud?
What do you mean?
What are the boys like?
Well do you like him?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Does your mother know?
Why didn't you do something?
What do I do then?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
It's like a secret society.
What year are you in?
I'm sorry that was out of line.
Just a kiss, right?
Want a blow job?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Good luck, Sebastian.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Is she with you?
One.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
What's wrong?
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
I don't find this very funny,
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
You can put it anywhere.
Fuck her yet?
Shut up.
Nothing.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Bad time?
You didn't?
Tell me all the details.
I'm not in the mood.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
You're too kind.
What about her?
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
She's out.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
What time is it?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
What song, dear?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Where'd you get this, darling?
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Where is everybody?
What is it, Alice?
Ollie.
It's your play.
I thought you were with Amy.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
I got lots of presents.
Where did you mail them?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
Now Amy
And who did the voice belong to?
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
I shall want you for always.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Oh, how beautiful!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
I can sea its breath in the cold.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
But I only came to give back the ring.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
I like stories.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
And does he kill people?
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Let the child stay.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
What?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How's the rest of your health?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
How have you been feeling?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Translation: a total geek.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
Can't you get contacts?
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
DON'T call the police.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
You expecting someone?
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I do development for TV movies.
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
My apartment's just such a mess.
You look different. I mean you look good.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Where'd you get the bike?
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No, she died when I was twelve.
What are those?
What's wrong?
Everything okay?
Uh.... hi!
You had a date with Carlton?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
I'm going to take a shower.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
We can get a warrant if you like.
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
You think mafia hit?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
What's he doing here?
Police.  Nobody move.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Good evening, sir.
What about Thompson, sir?  WasnĂ­t this his case?
Why do you want to speak to him?
ItĂ­s extremely important to my investigation...
Lost something?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
DonĂ­t ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
IĂ­m your new assistant.
You typed this report?
How can I submit this?
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Don't know that either.
You see it?
Where does it lead?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
DonĂ­t kill me!
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
What does she say?  The woman.
Bad dreams?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
What are you doing?
Why?
What happened to you?
How do you know I'm innocent?
How much do you usually get paid?
What's with her?
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What the hell is this?
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Die, you pond scum!
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
A condition...
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Uh, let me get back to you...
What are you gonna do?
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
What I told him to?
And who's gonna find out?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Will he be alright?
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Dave!
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Alan...
`Dave'?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
This is from the people of Burundi...
What are they?
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
Yeah.
... Sometimes they do.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Really?
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
I was waiting for that jack.
What's that?
Well...
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Oh... Yeah.
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
You sure this goes somewhere?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
Yes.
Well I guess...
Yeah.   He's a good man.
I never thought I'd...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Please....shoot me.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
What is it?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
What is it?
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
What?
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
It's been fired.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
They're townies?!
So?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Mr. Keating!
Don't stop.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Who else was involved in this?
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Who's in?
Nuwanda, what is going on?
You what?!  How did you do that?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
It's all right, Chet.
Don't stop.
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Chris!
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Knox, I don't believe this!
But I love you.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
A sweaty-toothed madman
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
You really think I should forget her?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
But father, it's not fair.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father!
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
What?
So?
Er  No.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
You the Captain?
Who are you?
It's not going to help us!
They are...they are everywhere.
Who?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
We were talking about my schedule...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Now look what you did!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
I don't know where it is!
Got it?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
Man, don't go up there...
What was that?
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
You want 'em?
Damn right!
It is not!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Tell him, Vince!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
I got delayed. I --
Sure. Why not.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
I have to go.
See, I'm going home.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You mean...?
You like to call me Linda now?
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Hey, guys...
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Rough, huh?
Not so good.
Sal.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
You can do it, Sal.
Merle?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You do?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Is he from here?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What are you, hoping?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
No.
That's it. No. No way.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Great. That's great.
See you Monday.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
You didn't get a deer?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Up I would say... What would you say?
Up a little there... What would you say?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
My man Dubbs.
Funny guy.
Mug sheets.
Give it to me.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Sir, your limo's here.
You sure?  I can help you.
See those guys?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Married?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Yeah.
You never want to find out.
But he was such a good cop.
You could always take it off.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Belle --
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
You know that you're in my house.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
What's that, sir?
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Howdy, Jabez.
Loan shark -- hey?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
-- in gold.
Afraid ... of what?
Where did it come from?
It's mine?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
What -- what's on your mind?
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Oh!
But -- I was just lucky.
Why of course --
Dan'l Webster?
Yes.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Jabez -- help!
He's stubborn as a Stone.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Your butter money?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
What do you think of that, Jabez?
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
But I'm glad to be home again --
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Mary! Come back ...
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
You found it in the barn, hey?
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
What's that you say, Son?
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Ma -- is she? --
I want you to fix these fish!
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Hello, Sheriff.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
The police...?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
New York...
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
How long?
Three down, four to go --
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
They would, huh?
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
'Roy'.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
This is --
So whatsa deal?
These seats come out?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Jenny?
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Well.... huh ...
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
So... that sure is something.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Denmark?  Sweden?
Would you do something for me? Please?
Yeah.
I don't have a choice.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
What kind of things, Leon?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
How many you got in there?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Okay, give us the women.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
The girl hostages.
What the fuck do you want?
Don't fuck with me ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
Now, you -- what's your name?
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
You got kids?
Do you think we can turn it on?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Yeah.
You got Bank Americard?
You all right?
It's up to you ladies.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
I used to, but I stopped.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
What?
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Okay - you got your one.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Hey, let's get ready!
Here's your document, Sonny.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
What is it, Choco?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.

I've already formulated a plan.
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.

We're late.

You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.

What did he do this time?
Don't come back, either.
Mookie.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Squash it.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Ten.
Fifty cents.
Jade.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
I'll do.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
How many you say?
It's dug.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Keep it.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
No.  What are you gonna do?
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
What else?
Tina, you're sweating.
Later for you.
Feels good.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Shaddup, Vito.
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Whaddup.  Money?
I'm listening.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Hey!  Watch it.
Pop, stop lying.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Take it easy, Pop.
No, I'm not it.
Oh my god, are you alright?
But I came here to learn about America.
Hi.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
What are you wearing?
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I didn't know that.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Owww.
Who's your partner?
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
I kinda screwed things up.
Captain Rob came back?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
Well, I'm listening now.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
But my mom gave me the map.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Why ith dat newth?
What are you doing here?
What?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
What are you doing?
That's my boyfriend.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
How much homework is there?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
How was that?
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
And, take some more pictures.
Knock knock.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
It's a surprise.
Where is it?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
You know the ancient tongues?
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Long live the fighters!
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
... Many men have tried.
You mustn't speak of...
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Bela, what happened?!
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
And, cut...
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Um, okay... roll camera
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
You're a fuckin' mess.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Tor, I should be getting home.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Can I help you?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Is there a script?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Lugosi?
OUR picture?
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
I got married last night.
Oh, it's you again.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
You're <u>sure</u>???
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
They celebrated the common person.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
How's your mother?
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
How you doing, Ed?
Uh-huh?
They tore her dress! ...
Great line.
Ed, do you want my advice?
I don't think so.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
What?
You said that.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
No.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
He had girlfriends!
Eddie...
To you? In front of him?  With the...
What's going on over there?
Right, yeah --
What is she, at work?
She won't.
What does this mean?
I batted!
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Go!
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
I'm sorry.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Okay.
I need to talk.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
I got your message. Way to go!
Why do you do that?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Who is it?
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Why me?
You know what your problem is?
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
El/ella -
But you haven't written your novel.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Tracy.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Thanks for everything.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Where to?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
What a surprise.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Hmm?
Exactly when?
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Yep.
Three twenty-five.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
These are private -- these are for us.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
I mean at you.
Who put you up to this?
Hell, good luck!
Yes, Paul?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
You dumbshit!
What do you want?
That obvious, huh?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
In the morning.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Yeah, I hate them.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Maybe.  I don't know.
That's him.  That's him.
What's through here?
Where are we going?
How's it going to look on your report?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
You expecting problems?
Bud...
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
What do you mean?
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
Dudley, we've been over this.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Yes, I do, sir.
Ed, I want confessions.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Something like that.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
You're the key witness?
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
So what's the point?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
What are you going to do?
What's on the call sheet?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
A vulgar term, but yes.
Lynn Bracken.
How about White?
Where will you go?
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
A sweet man.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
Not a word.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Have we met before?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Working whores with squad two.
What happened?
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
What kind of a question is that?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You knew the deal. No contact.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I'll pay you.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
What'd I tell you?
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Think we let out enough air?
Fuckin-A.
Drive.
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
Feeling lucky?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Do you see anything you like?
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
What?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
Stacy--
I know.
Is Eric in school?
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
They're saying you killed that policeman.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
I've never met him?
This conversation's over.
You're a moron, you know that?
Any idea what he looks like?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Robert--
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Who won the fight?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I don't know. I mean--
Turn yourself in.
Yeah?
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
It's been a few years.
Well we'd sure like to help you.
Then what's your goddam opinion?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
It means who's side are you on?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
No sir.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Federal Express?
How'd you get in the building?
Then let's assume I don't.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry itÂ
DaskylusÂ
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
That insults them.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
You sing.  All the time.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Don't.
What else?
Arabic?
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Dance with me.
Why did you hate me?
You're wearing the thimble.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Safe journey.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die FĂźhrer!  Il Duce.
I believe I'm rather late.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
David Caravaggio.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Or was it Toronto?
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
What do you want?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Hana tells me you're leaving.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
The team is in mourning, darling.
Right.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
He's Canadian.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
I'll probably marry him.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Arguing about books.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
No. But he hands them over.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
You've got a mustache.
Yessir.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! AlmĂĄsy looks uncomfortable.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
Or my wife's.
And the draft blew over the flowers.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
How about if I try humility.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
You're not taking me seriously.
For God's sake.
The Empress Death Mask.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Fine. What do I do?
It's a fake.
That's entrapment.
And--
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
I'll need that.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Why don't we take oxygen?
I didn't mean to get personal.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Thank you.
Won't take any time.
He wasn't.
Camera in the--
One, two, three...
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Can you see the other PIRs?
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Your share.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Oh my god, I thought--
The eight billion. From them to us.
Peoples China Bank.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
You can't be serious.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
But would you--would you--
Come on.
Hang on.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
--You're a cop.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Tonight your league night?
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
There's more than one?
How does someone get meningitis?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
The judge came up with a number.
I can put them in a good school.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
What are you doing here?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
So what made you think it was?
What medical records?
This is the only thing you found?
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You think there's more?
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
I want my fucking money --
I'll see what I can do.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Ho - ly - shit.
I don't know what to say.
I was wrong.
What is that?
Two million dollars?
How many counts?
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
You've been reading for hours.
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Which number do you want, George?
You're around every afternoon?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
You are someone.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
You already packed up your stuff?
Thank you.
Hello?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Where's my paycheck?
What?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
There's something else, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Wow, that's soon --
Who's Baxter?
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
... Luke, you must not go.
Barks his concern.
Barks at his master.
Barks his consternation.
... Like we're being watched.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Mine, mine.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Sir, I was wondering ...
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
I don't know what he's talking about.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Are you crazy!
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
I don't like this.
About what?
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
Are you kidding?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
It's a lovely outpost.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
We've got to find Luke.
What?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Someone's falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
I can't. It's too big.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
But tell me why ...
Did you call the Zoo?
Nobody's going to believe it.
What, Lewis?
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Primitive?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Where is he?
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Defense against what?
Not you?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Stop the damn car.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
What are they?
Don't follow me.
Snake - what is it?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
All of us?
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
He can be no other.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
How? Where?
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Excalibur! Is it true?
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
Yes.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
What is this place, Merlin?
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
Why can't you be my champion?
And you cannot love me...
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
A lovestruck page!
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
The oath. You didn't say--
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Hello?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Didn't who tell me?
What did the doctor say?
Phonograph.
It's serious?
Oh, she'd love it.
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Rats?
There is nothing.
Is it coming out Willie?
A stimulant.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
What kind of stuff?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Oh look at that.
Captain who?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Oh I bet he is.
Regan, why are you reading that?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
I believe you.
You just missed them.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And also with you.
The Lord be with you.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Who?
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
...Be gone!!
...look down in pity...
Trunks?
Honey ...
Beasley.
What's our friend's problem?
What do you do to him?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Jack.
Count it.
So we on tomorrow night?
You're their uncle.
What d'ya got?,
What d'ya got?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
What was it like?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Get out of here.
Hey, Frank.
I thought we had separate rooms.
You leaving that on?
Why would I mind?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
How's it coming?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
The party's over.
They were simple songs.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
Cancel, Frank.
Nothing. We get nothing.
You don't know?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Jack, you're on television.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
So what'd you think?
This where the auditions are?
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
Where's your dress?
Come on.  We don't have much time.
A seven.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Fucking.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
He's right.
I don't believe it.
Hey, we're connected.
Great?
What'd she sing?
Hey, will you look at that?
What's with you guys?
Huh?
Uh ...
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Thanks.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
All right.  Hold on.
No.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
You miss him, don't you?
Fucking.
Forget it.
He do that every year?
Aren't the kids asleep?
How's egghead?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
How do you do it? Every night?
All I said was you were good.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Frank said ---
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Guess they're up.
How'd the show go?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
He's lying.
Where am I?
And this thing can grow it?
What do you mean?
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
For being one helluva guy.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
No.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
Go on.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Which ear was it?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You killed them?
What are you going to do, Castor?
Stay away from my family!
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
You've got someone in your office.
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
You merciless bastard!
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Just following your example.
You'd have to start immediately.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
The hospital.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
I'll deal with her later.
I'm going to the powder room.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
ThatÂs right. And auto supply...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
And I know people.
This isnÂt my real life. ItÂs just a glimpse...
What are you doing?
Is it morning yet?
Trouble at work?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnÂt the life I dreamt about.  WhereÂs the romance, whereÂs the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you canÂt have...
Damn...
She is relentless.
She said that?
CÂmon, Evelyn ThompsonÂs got no class.  She doesnÂt marry Dr. Steve, the womanÂs living in a trailer.
So Jack, itÂs your wifeÂs birthday, got anything to say to her?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  YouÂre doing well...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Yeah?  What do you need?
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Miss me, Jack?
You?  What about me?  IÂm working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
But what do I do?
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
I donÂt care who you are.  ItÂs Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
KateÂs on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
I have a bad feeling about this.
DonÂt  go, Jack...
Look, we donÂt have time for this right now, weÂll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  YouÂre not wearing that to the ThompsonsÂ party. I donÂt care how hilarious you think it is...
You look forward to this party all year.  WhatÂs with you today?
ShouldnÂt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
Excuse me?
Well...Annie for one.
CÂmon.
Maybe I should wait...
You really are incredible...
HereÂs the thing.  I really hadnÂt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversaryÂs good all day...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
So whatÂs the big surprise? You didnÂt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Annie goes to a great school.
I promise, Jack...
You look great.
So youÂre not at a non- profit firm?
DonÂt get on that plane!
No...
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Peter Lassiter...
...weÂre really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
IÂll go for a cup of coffee!
I mean...
I'm not really dressed for a party.
What about his first born?
You got a chisel round here?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
We're working as hard as we can --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
Ben, come in.
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
It's just business.
'Scuse me.
Okay to proceed.
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
Benes... What the devil happened?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Yes, Alan.
Difficult? He's impossible!
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
Look at that...they're changing color...
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
A surgeon might...
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
What can we do?
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
You said there was a quick way out!
About forty miles an hour.
A what?
Sounds like heavy artillery...
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Sabotage? I don't understand...
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Yes, there is.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
One of us pays the other for half.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Well, okay, it's -
Three people. In Brainerd.
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Any others?
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
How ya doin'?
Yah.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
A subconscious-type thing.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yah, real good.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Well... yah.
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
We're good to loan in.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
You're darned tootin'!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Hiya, Lou.
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Where is everybody?
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
You look in his citation book?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Yah - how are you doon?
...What can I get ya?
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Yah?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Not on your feet too much?
Your mallard?
It's just the three cent.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
What... ?
You are a moron.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I want that.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
This could go on for hours.
It's time for you to leave.
I don't know ...
No, thanks.
Where?  Here?
Here.
You feel nothing?
You... don't have to... leave.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
That... sawing and hammering.
No.
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is that what you're calling it?
Say my name.
Let go of me!
What happened... ?
Who did this to you?
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
Tell the other person how you feel.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
This is how I met --
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Well, uh... great.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
A nice, big cock.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't know about this.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
You?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
You want to finish her off?
What is this place?
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I'm not asking you to.
I don't know!  Nothing!
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Can't you call it off... ?
What the fuck -- ?
What?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Do something for me.
Look at me...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Abort the plan.
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Ain't that something?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
What are you doing?!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Biology, mostly.
I... I don't know...
Yeah, how?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
What about that?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
What did you see?
No!  It can't be.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
You've made your point.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
What?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Tell me again how it started.
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
This is cheery.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Whoa, nine months?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
That's why I was there last night.
This place?!
4:25.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Can't you open the door?!
Police are coming.
I'll remove him.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I'm sorry we broke in.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
You guys are real... aren't you?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Ever do this from a jet?
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Yeah.  Why not?
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
You never been in one of those things.
Where did you find this clown?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Intelligence work.
Look, Co...
Stay on your heading, Captain.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
What's the job?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
Take your time.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
I... You're not going to understand this.
Hello....congratulations.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Have I died?
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
.....What are you doing?
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
You a fag too?
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
I advise you to let us go.
Parry Parry?
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Well, it's enough for me.
Excuse me...
No.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Well, id'n that nice.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Rayette.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Bobby...
Alaska.
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No substitutions.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Maybe you better stay, then.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where is she, anyway?
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have you been doing since then?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
You don't call that music, though.
No, it isn't what I think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
What kind of doggy is that?
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Well...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Miss Dupea.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Not now, I'm busy
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
So watcha doin'?
So what's her name?
So what you think of me?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
So what do you want with her anyway?
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
That's what he said.
I wasn't asking.
Hey, what are you doing?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Fletch.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
No children?
Mrs. Smith.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
So what do you figure?
No idea at all?
You find the source?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Oh my God!
Here you are, Doctor.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Read this, please.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Right.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
He sighs.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
ItÂs okay. The cops did it.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Why don't you try suicide?
I'm still here.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Do you have a passport?
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Shoot.
Did you hear something?
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
Thanks.
My hero.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
That's a strange combination.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Good point.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
So?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
No.
You can't do that.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
One.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
You want I set up?
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
Fletch.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Who?
How gray?
How could you call him?
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Did she tell you anything?
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
I do it for love.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
I came to warn you...
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Three hundred.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Are you okay?
Gut feeling.
Who cares?  I got a case.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
I'm sorry...
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
The point?
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
Jazz, we're talking here.
It doesn't have to be like this?
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
Shit.
So...
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
How's everything?
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
What?
No... yeah...
Man, I'm clean.
Did you pick up the car?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Comment va-t-elle?
Il est en retard.
There'll be someone else.
It's beautiful.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
I got no music!
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Where's he from?
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
When ya go back on?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
Popeye.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Same car.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Yeah.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
How do we get to the vault door?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
It looks open on the other side.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
I'm off.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I swear, Satch.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
You ready?
Uh, hello?
What'd you say your name was?
No, not yet.
What's that?
No wait, don't go!
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
John, you there?
My father didn't die in a fire?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
He ain't our guy, John.
I look familiar?
No kiddin'?
Huh.
Hell-
Fuck you, asshole.
Going?  How do you mean?
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Who brought up this bright idea?
How about a roll in the hay?
What're you doin'?
I'm a slow eater.
Which one is it?
Come on down!
What's this?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
What do you mean?
What d'ya got in there?
What are we gonna do?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Are they following us?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Darren, we better turn around.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
Whaddya mean?
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Jason who?
But, Dad, we...
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
I thought Jason was only a legend?
No.  No, it's not...
So what are ya drawin'?
Lake Forest Green?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
So where's Cort gone off to?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Yes!
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Well, let's hope not!
No, I --
Everything going okay?
Legs giving you trouble?
I gotta get back to work.
Good night, beautiful.
Why did you want her body?
Tell me.
Lock this asshole up.
Why didn't you tell me?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Wanna know how I did that?
Don't do anything stupid.
I know what it sounds like.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
What are you going to do?
Time to check out the waiters.
Well...how do you feel?
Did you hear that?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
But I thought...
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
What are you doing in here?
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Did you find Rennie?
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What a beautiful day.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
I heard you weren't coming.
I got you a present.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
I didn't mean for you to go!
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
You have to call the police...
Big mess every time.
We must abandon.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
Very dangerous.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
It's just a review.
And he was there?
What?
How do you Eknow.
Had to be him.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
What are we talking about?
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
This could Pbe it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
What about her?
She died.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
We're able to surprise each other.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
Where the hell are you?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
Let's not start that again.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
You're charming the boy.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Don't worry. It's a test.
Then they lost?
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
And the Father replies?
This could be it.
You've worked with Elliot?
Endearing.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
But you're his friend.
Home.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
Please! You're being foolish!
What do you expect when you talk like that?
No violence, please.
What are you doing?
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
What can we do?
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
You're an ambitious man.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
You mean a general strike?
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
They're sparing no one, I see.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
The fools!  Sorry...
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You almost sound like you believe that.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
That's the last.
We believe we have a suspect.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
At least it's nothing contagious.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
What about this?
You really need that much?
It's not too late to back out.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
You wish.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
It's all right.
What makes them think that?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
How are you, Jerome?
I have your samples ready.
What will happen to the others?
Vincent...Vincent...
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
You didn't know?
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
--when you go away.
Flight got you nervous?
What are you doing?
The name?  For the certificate.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
What about your wife?
I'm in a hurry.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Hello, Doc.
Where did you get those?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
How's Estelle?
That's not all of it.
Wait... give me a minute.
Really?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Doc...
Who's she?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
Are you hungry?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Can we make it?
I don't know.
You okay?
I don't know, airport I guess.
No, I'm not.
Yeah. I got out.
Two.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
How's Mama and the kids?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You got it.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
A couple of weeks back.
What did you do?  Albert?
You knew what I'd do.
What about the brakes?
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
She's nothing to do with me.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Do you?
Sid Fletcher.
Yes.
Could you do me a favour?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
That's why you waited for me.
And you didn't know her last name?
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
See you later.
I'm staying with a friend.
So shut up.
What you going to do?
Is he?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Jack! I didn't like that.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Nasty way to go.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Ask me?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Deadbeats all.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
It is.
I...
No.  That's absolutely right.
Yes.
No.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He's doing very well.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
You...
You build it!
...you're absolutely right.
Should do something to them.
Yes.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
No.
You're going to steal the leads?
Yes.
A job with Graff.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
...I thought that we were only talking...
I didn't ask to be.
Fine.
Yes.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
He said he filed...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Were the leads...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Yeah.
Why don't you think so?
Where were you?
Yes.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Did they...?
That's great.
Shelly: get in the office.
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Mmm.
Excuse me, fella.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
You have a problem?
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
What about the other two?
...no...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Why?
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Alright.
Now?  Now?
Why?
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Mmm.
What are you trying to tell me?
Excuse me...
How do you know I made it up?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
It was his idea.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
I've got the check...
Don't.
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Shelly...!
Fuck you, Dave...
Fuck her...
...yes...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Ricky, I...
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
I've got to talk to you.
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
Monday.
When did you write the check?
What was yesterday?
And when was that check cashed?
She wants her money back.
I can't regotiate.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
The deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
They got, listen to me...
Yes.
...you want to go out today...?
Three?  I count two.
Yes.
Do you like them?
Why do you have to go?
What position did you occupy?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Then why do you come to me?
Is Kay coming?
I don't want to stay here...
The child cannot harm you.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
I understand...
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I asked about Fredo?
Go on, tell me.
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
Fifteen percent skim?
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
You're right.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Does it feel like a boy?
Where?
Why don't you sit down?
His brother came to help him.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
Where can we talk?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You said you were Klingman.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
I just left our friend in Miami.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Says who?
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
He don't want to talk?
You want a war?
What's this?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
I accept your generosity...
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Something I can do for you?
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
I'm not married.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You did not know?
It's not what you think.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
What have you done with him?
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Is this David's doing?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
No.
Does that surprise you?
I never thought you were.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
Who's that?
No.  The girl.
Let's get out of this funk hole
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Do you mind?
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
No.  It won't do.
I don't know.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
You okay?
Did I hurt you?
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Mr. Kay, sir.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
This is the studio where I paint.
Then the rumors are true?
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
What are you doing here?
What about?
It seems she neglected to mention it
Who was the job for?
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
They gave you only four days?
I'm just here about my brother.
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Well, that certainly won't do.
I know you --
How's that?
You'll leave -- ?
You have my word...
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
I know you.
You seem a little hinked-up ...
It just ain't happening --
okay ...
Got it ...
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
How's it going -- ?
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
How you know that?
You look good...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I know...
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Hey, Kip, what's up?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
He's gonna kill you -- !
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Too early to tell. Nervous?
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Take it back, Freb --
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
How's it going?
Call 911 -
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
What kind of trouble -- ?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
Ready -- ?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Unlock your button ...
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
Hear you roar ...
What are you doing... ?
She does have one thing you don't.
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Which way's out, man -- ?
What? What happened?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
I'm gonna need some money.
Henry.  Wake up.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
What'll I tell Fran?
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
You know what to do?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
Thanks, Chuck.
How's the woman?
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
I guess so.
Is this a bad time?
Jesus.
Did she get my Double Burger?
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
You want us to give you cash right now?
How'd you like that course?
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
And what do you see?
No, there's a limit.
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
--that?--
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
What are you smiling at?
I can come back.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
So who won the bet?
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
I got it.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
He married his cousin.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
Oh, come on, Sean--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Do you know when you'll be back?
What do you want to do?
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
Probably not.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
What does?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
No.
Why thank you.
No.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Well, are you going out again?
Why not?
My wife's dead.
My wife's dead.
Why not?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Where were you?
They're all dead.
Don't give me you line of shit.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
What?
Gotta go with the belt there...
I'll keep in touch.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
I bet you have a great family.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Where have you been?
Promise?
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
Why do we always stay here?
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
How's it goin'?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Yes, I do, Will.
Yeah.
Take care.
You doin' the hirin'?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
You bust outa jail, Tom?
That's not your affair. Name.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
That's the way it is.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
*You* find out, I can't.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Been out travelin' around?
And you ain't ashamed?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Is it fur?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Sure do.
Lookin' for a job?
I didn't mean nothing.
Yeah.
I never asked you!
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
How 'bout Granma?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Got any plants?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
But will it--hurt the baby?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Mad, Ma?
How about it, Ma?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Looks like you done it.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
Sure. Good-by.
Which ones?
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
How you get all this money?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
What's this?
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
--Stop it--
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Bob. Bob Destephano.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Remember high school?
It's me. Martin Blank.
What am I gonna do?
I want to be an actor.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Tell me about yourself.
That's it?
What's your business?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Are you going to the reunion?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Yes.
Hello...?
...Let me get my coat.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
He was trying to kill you, right!
...About five years now.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
I was leaving.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
How was your day, today, sir?
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
No deal.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
Well?
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Enough?
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
No, I don't have one.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
God it's great to see you.
No. You drove us here.
Ten years. What happened!?
He sells BMW's?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
How's that?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Why not?
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Enjoy the day.
Poor thing.
How did you meet her?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Everything under control?
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
No, you didn't.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Yeah?
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
Did he tell you that?
You buckled up?  You cold?
Did he mention it?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
What are you talking about?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Started what?
When? Tonight?
Who is it?
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Yes. We're suing.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
What did he say?
I should go get some of her things.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
What was I saying?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
Yeah, what?
Was the trip okay?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
Tom?
Would you let me ride your horse?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
That's not a question, is it?
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
Sure?
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Jude, you okay?
Don't be such a baby!
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
You're looking fit.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
What stuff is that?
How's it going, Ray?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Welcome to our show!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Dead.
Up all night again, huh?
What did we learn in school today?
Talk to me.
That's Razor and Blade.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
It's too much machine for you.
Name your stakes.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Ready?
Gill.
There's a new virus in the database.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Never fear. I is here.
What? whatwhatwhat?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
What is he doing in here?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
You're late.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Are you two okay?
Who's that?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
Mom, please
Can't you find somebody else?
Yes.
What the hell did this?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
What?
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie!
Rachel come on.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You won't look pushy.
Where are you going?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Something?
This is starting to spook me.
It's over.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sort of.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
You're going to be late!
It's been totally charted.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Shit!
Hello?
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Wait a minute here...
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I gotta go.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Exactly what do you need?
They could be.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Yes, I am.
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
What about the rest of my comic books?
What about the bogyman?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Right.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Laurie, you come with us...
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
She's washing her clothes.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
If you say so.
What did he say?
Hi.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Uh, who gets dropped first?
It's French, though.  It really is.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
You're joking.
And you, you-you're going?
Mm-hm.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
You're Holly.
Oh, what, what do you do?
It's really sad.
We could...we could do that.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Yeah, you would.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Page a hundred and twelve.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
She has all the cooking talent.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
I want one with you.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
...or films you must see or... 
What's the problem?
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, Jesus!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
It was on your shirt!
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
You're just realizing this now?
Yes, please.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Oh!
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Go right over there.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Gee.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
I want to experience childbirth.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Perfect!
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Okay.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
He's such a loser!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Hey, hi!
Boy--
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Oh, so loosely.
Well--
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Can we, can we go?
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
You're kidding me.
Really?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, God!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Thanks.
Mickey?
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
And?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Well.  Word gets around.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
...you...
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Bad beat today.
C'mon, pal.
How crazy is that.
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
What, What, I can't hear you...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
He escaped...
..It won't be long now, sir...
You give me whatever I want...?
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I said how's your baby...?
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
And?  Then?
Who does not?
...long overdue.
I require...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
You were given backup....
I realize, you're under a lot of....
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
The girl could use some help.
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I am on the track of...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
Then what brings you back?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
...yes...?
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Howdy Pouty.
Man, she's losing it...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Freeze!  You're busted!
Mine!
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
...sorry...
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
What in the hell did you do that for?
Hey.
Do you really not believe in God?
What else don't you believe in?
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
God, you're beautiful.
Two billion years of evolution and                          ] you're what we've come up with--                            ] "Wichita"--the hot, cool, tell-it-                          ] like-it-is counselor with a dark                            ] side.                                                       ]
Sorry Veronica.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
Oh, I have to hear this.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Where did you get these?
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Shit.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Good plan.
And your worst enemy.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Mute!
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
Perrier water!
Did you miss him completely?
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
We're breaking up. I am out!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
You going to eat this?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
What now?
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
Come on, sit up.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
Can I go now?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
My name is Gina!
Who cares!
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
You have to let me go!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
Hello!
I think I'm dying . . .
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
I shall call him Diello.
John has fallen in love with me!
I think I'm going crazy.
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Bye, Dad.
Isn't it beautiful!
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Sorry.
I understand... I won't-
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Must be nice.
GWEN?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Hello I'm Dr...
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
Do you know where you are?
What's under that sheet...?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
I didn't even know you had a kid.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Nothin'.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Bill, listen...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
You were... very... inspiring.
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
How'd it go?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
You test each one thoroughly?
So where are all your toys?
Where are these toys of yours?
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Baby, what is it?
Mommy!
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Where'd he go?
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
We're going to think about it.
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he said?
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
I hear things in this house,
How long does it have to be a new house?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Who was that?
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Shit!
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Tough.
Yes -- I think it is.
You?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
Thank you, Thomas.
As friends -- always as friends.
France.
What are we doing here?
To ask her to dance.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
I'll go first.
Your life.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Where did you get it?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Why?
You didn't answer my question.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Why not?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
He's in there!
We found him this morning.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
It has to be.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Is there anything else you need?
Don't leave us, Conner.
What are you doing?
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
What'd you find out?
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
Bullshit!
I have to tell you something --
We're cool.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
Give up.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
The cops are comin'!
What the fuck is that?
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
You have his address?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
How did you get this number?
What do you want?
I need to work out some stuff.
I'm not gonna leave you!
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
What do you want?
What?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Please get away from me.
You gotta pee?
I can't go without Thomas.
How can we get out?
What's going on?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
Sounds like you know the job.
It's right in front of us.
Chief, Mikkelson.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Where are you right now?
I think so.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Can you open them?
Where are my children?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Marlon and Al....
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
What happened?
Excuse me?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Who are you?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Ten.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Anything. Strong.
What is it?
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders Âwe must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.Â What do you think would have happened? No different.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Where are my supplies?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
Where are they going?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
You are a marked man.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
) You cannot kill them all.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Are you sure this is the river road?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Who did you call?
What do you want?
The commander is not here.
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
Was there blood?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
The president has been murdered.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Oh, my God!
Any luck?
Has Roger spoken yet?
How can we help him.
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
Please, please try one more time.
We are almost out of water.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
That is why they call it coach?
You have taken business class?
What do we do with all these people?
What are you doing?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Paul, are you there?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Oh, for chrissake --
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
You're not my list.
There must be some other way out.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
What's in there?
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Pritchett, is that you?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
Is she...alright?
Thanks.
There's always exceptions.
We can do it...
Price!!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
...Jesus H. Christ.
Then who are they?
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
I was in the middle of --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
First time for everything.
Do something!
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
I'm ready now.
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
What're you talking about?
Sorry.
-- the window and door grates --
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Fascinated.
Please! I need your help.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Oh, no.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Ghosts killed your father?
Excuse me?
-- hey! --
-- Eddie!!
For the love of God....please...?
Damn it.
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
We don't have proof of that.
They don't build them like this anymore.
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Help me!  Please!!!
What's he doing daddy?
Why?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
To our family.
No.
But do you agree with me?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
How are we doing?
Maura!
Maura.
You must be a Londrigan.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Your daughter's been taken.
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Keep talking!
The rain is letting up.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
There's something through that wall!
Not on station time.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Wha .... ?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Welcome. 38
Thank you.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Yes really.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
What ... What ... ?
Yes.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
That was beautiful.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
We're going in from the ground floor.
Don't you just hate kids...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Hit me with your best shot.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
And I'll bring my entourage...
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
I hope you know what....
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Get away from there, convict!
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Thanks for sharing.
If you do anything to my friend...
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
Snappy.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
A sawbuck!
What a horrible little person.
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
I'm sure I --
Well, I --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Muncie.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
My pleasure, sir.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
...Why, this is worthless.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
Awwww, buddy --
...You don't?
...It is?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But, Buzz --
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Sir?
Well, frankly, I...
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Ya don't say.
How's that, Sid?
Yellowstone.
Hello, Niagara.
She isn't!
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
At the Houmfort.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Where were you trained?
That will mean another interview, won't it?
But it's so far away...
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
But don't you have to work?
That doesn't sound like him.
No, Wes.
Can't I take it for you?
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I've never given it much thought.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I told you.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
I don't know -- I don't know--
An accident at the mill?
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Benjie!
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
Good night.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
I... I think I am...
What?
Dinner in ten minutes.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
If you're going to insult me --
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
That this was going to be a key party?
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Ready to go?
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
I'm fine dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Classes?
Grades?
About?
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Good-night dad.
Talking to me, dad?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
Thank you Janey.
You want coffee or something?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You okay?
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
I saw you on your bike today.
Mikey Williams?
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Now you are being rude.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
No candy for me?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
No one.
Want some gum?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Wow!
When worlds collide.
You get in trouble?
Is this Charles?
Just thought I'd stop by.
It feels warm.
Yes, sir.
Nice kid.
I have to get back.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
Duggar called him?
Sorry about...
Thanks.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
We're sure it's hers?
I'll call him now.
Forget your pager?
Where you signed this?
Did she?
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
One word to I.A. and he walks.
I was her best friend.
You want me to take you somewhere?
She wouldn't tell me!
It was like some big fucking secret!
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
What are we?
That is a picture, nothing more.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
But why?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
I couldn't prevent it.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
And yet you knew what I would o.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
I want some more.
But you're the fairest by far.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
You want me to be a doll forever?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
What was that?
The ship is sailing wihout us!
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
You've just done it -
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Take him.
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
What do you imagine you are Louis?
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Lestat!
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
I have to go now Lestat...
But why did you tell her?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Lestat escaped the fire!
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Storm season?
Get lost, you scared me.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
I thought you were out of town!
There's nothing between Will and me.
He does work hard.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
You get any sleep at all?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Ray, I can't...
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Never do that again.
Deep breaths --
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Julie? What's wrong?
There was a body! I swear it!
Why are you doing this to me?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
To a great weekend --
Why? He can't help us.
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Cool.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
Where is everybody?
They were cut loose.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
There was some trouble here ÂÂthe villagers on the mainland Â-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ÂÂbroke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
What are you doing?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill ÂÂ or frightened.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
What would I be thinking?
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live Â- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
This girl --
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
It makes me fear her.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
I've seen men die drunk Â- and I've seen men die of the plague.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle Â-
I have had command for the last time Â-
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" Â-
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -Â
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family ÂÂ no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
I told you ÂÂ I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
I . . .
She's . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
I know. I know. He didn't go.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Hey, Ernie!
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Well, sure I do.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Hee-haw!
Goodbye, everybody!
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Sure ÂÂ Sam Wainwright.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Well then, how do you know?
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
Anything I can do back here?
Is it a charge, sir?
Okay ÂÂ all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about ÂÂ build things . . . design new buildings ÂÂ plan modern cities ÂÂ all that stuff I was talking about.
Where are you going?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Why didn't you call me?
Holy mackerel!
Those Rockefellers!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I'm not very good at this.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Eighteen.
If I told you it might not come true.
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, George, George!
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
How fast does this go?
You can?
For me...?
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Get on the rocks!
Maybe by now they are.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Shut up.
Coming up!  Give way!
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
What is it?  What's there?
Chief....
Chief?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Do I have to?
I'm going.
Dad, I'm sorry....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Wait a minute....
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
What makes you think there might be?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Oww!
No.
What?
That you were fired.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
I'll give notice.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Can I go swimming?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
What's wrong?
I want you to meet my cousin.
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Get a dance yet?
Come on back up here!
Give me back my hat!
Be careful....
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
You do everything your parents tell you?
I thought you were grounded.
What's wrong?
I want Fruit Loops!
I want to go with you!
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
What do I do now?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
What's wrong?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Michael...
You're going down there again?
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
They said you'd be here.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
No, we'll go through here.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Somebody better get down there!
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I'm sorry.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
I want that shark alive.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Let's hope he knows that.
Some miss all their shots.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Hi, Mike.
'Course they're also so rich.
How long you staying?
I'm a water-skier.
Herpes?
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Told you you'd like it.
Take it up.
What're you doing later?
Ahhh, ahhh...
Yes, there is goes.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Yeah, well I didn't!
Polar bears.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
That's impossible.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Come on, sweetheart....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
No fair, I'm not armed.
Henny Youngman....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
That....
That hurt....
Can I ride one sometime...?
Sit down, Ma....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Dad died from a heart attack....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
You're having a good time....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
You hungry?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
No....
It's just like driving a car....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You promised me a drink....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
Grab your socks....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Still tagging conch?
I stuck them on, man....
Money is money....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
How many?
I wish you wouldn't say that....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
Okay.. .we're done, man....
And it's always worked?
What's so funny about that?
Stop that!
I don't like the song.
All the time....
Who grows more beautiful....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
What do you think?
You gotta stop smoking ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
Did he shut you down?
Stop it.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
Is this normal?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Vehicle references.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
Yes, Sir.
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
Can I see your hands?
Me?
Did Amber have a dog?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Oh.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Pray?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
I know what you're like ..
Why?
You do?
Who sought the warrant?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
You want something, darling?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Who told you?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Now.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
I just heard.
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Listen to me!
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
No no...
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Wonder what he said.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Well.
Yeah, I did.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
That's the girl I love.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Denver is where he should be.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
I got it.
You love me now, don't you?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
--  the kwan.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
No, I air-dry.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Why not --
Jerry!  You made it --
I have to ask.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
How can I make your life better?
You gonna get that --
I'll go back to them.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Pardon me?
You...
They do, my brother.
I won't tell.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
What did you say?
It's not safe.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Well what?
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
What?...WHAT!?
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
Where's Dad?
I donÂt know.
Eric!
How was your trip? Profitable?
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
ALAN!
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Why?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
We're safe!
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
It matches the pictures.
Resentful.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
Are you looking for a problem?
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I could come with you.
Cancel that, Dieter.
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
What is?
What is that?
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
Their what?
What?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
There' no reason for name calling.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
No.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
So that others would know about this place?
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
-- way we could safely --
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
You shouldn't use my name.
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
What?  No menthol?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
So what are you thinking?
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
I'm going with you.
I know, it's very exciting.
Unpredictability....
Yes?
Hola, Juanito
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
I threw up.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
I can't!  I'm scared!
Go, go, go, jump!
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
You got any kids?
You're married?
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Tim!  Lex!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
All night?
Go away!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thatĹĄs all it is!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
That's not funny.
No, but...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Quite a circus.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
It's still on.
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Cute waitresses?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
See this?
Add it to the list.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
What are you doing?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Where's he going?
What's that?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Are you all right?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
You look like brothers.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
You work in the cemetery.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
It's my last and final one.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No, sir.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
All these in the last year?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
Ludwig.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
What was it, Jack?
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Enjoy.  Well --
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Why isn't he locked up?
What was better? I made better bait?
Oh no.
-- We can talk --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
What is it?
What about?
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
What? This?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Well do you think it was him?
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Is there anything more I could --
What're you gonna do next?
You said it was!
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
How can you do it to yourself?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Bree --
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
What?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Are you closing the case?
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Where is the child?
What do you have here, Billy?
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
When is mommy coming back?
You forgot the milk.
Will she pick me up after school?
Okay...Same as usual...
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
All it is is onions and gravy.
I think I'm going to throw up.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Is mom ever coming back?
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
See.  That's my name.
What did you do when you were little?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
What don't you understand, pal?
Your mom.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
And what is your present salary?
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
I consider it less my failure than his.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Only can I still see him?
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
What the hell is this?
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Oh, Christ!
What if I fight it?
John?
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
She ever ask about me?
Huh.. .Hello?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Goodbye, Kundun.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Did you receive the letter?
And the United Nations? Surely?
Who am I?
Do I have money?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
Is that big?
Will we be in this war?
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
What can I do? I am only a boy.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
What is the size of our army, now?
Did you ever doubt it?
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
We have enemies.
Yes.
You will not come?
I do.
Much too young.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
You're a beautiful woman.
Keystone what?
Jesus Christ!!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
What's that?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
No!
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
Where?  Where?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
Where is he?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
He was an Indo-pacific.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Excuse me?
What?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
What are you doing?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Thing we can lift it?
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Really--
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
We gotta get to Hector!!
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
You think?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
This is a little different.
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
Not yet.
What?
You have a thing against museums?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Hey!!
What is this?
Hank?
Kelly.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Sorry?
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
<u>You</u>?
Boy, is that smart...
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
You're all right! Where is he?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Okay, Miss Starling?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
Why not?
Are you finished?
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
I am, yes.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Five... so far.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
By the book, he's a sadist.
They all were.
A moth... How did you predict that?
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
Horses - and sheep...
Two months.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Yes... I did.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
What is it?
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
One called Magua arrived.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
How far is it, scout?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
And if we're unlucky?
Any powder?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
What is enough?
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Such as...?
The honors of war?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
You mind if I take a look at this?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
And?
They found this?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
It's got Hazy!
I thought they were your friends?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Go on!
That's an order!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
No.  I'm just being friendly.
What are you doing?
We made it!
Something wrong, Cobb?
Charge set?
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Listen to it for Christsake.
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
What's going on?
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Getting some food.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Clear for pickup.
What on earth's the matter with you?
It needs blood?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Bacon, see what we got.
I thought this was a pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
I hate these Southern shites.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
They were going to pay, then?
Son, have a look in his locker.
Son?
You all right back there, mate?
Yeah?
Is that you, Dean?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Who was that?
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Yeah, one of them's out.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
That's it all done, we are off.
I hope this is the right move.
There's nothing in it!
What the hell are you doing here?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That's if I want to see you.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
What are you doing, Plank?
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
The money, the gear!
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
--you're going to be on your own.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Do whatever they tell you--
You're dismissed.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
And you and Private Graves--
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Sam the Man.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
You still going to all the home games?
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
No. You?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
Hey, it's the General.
I never met her.
My mother said he never asked about--
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
PDA?
So how come you got into all this?
So I'm part-Indian?
I have a B average.
Tanks, huh?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
This place is a gold mine.
What?
Right.
Cliff--
You going to get married?
Mikey--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
So where does that put us?
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Black Seminoles?
That where he was shot?
This is an official visit, then--
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Reputation?
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Is very beautiful, your car.
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
That so?
Never heard from him again?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
He still living?
Besides my father, I mean.
Charley Wade.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
There was a mandate in the last election--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Why would I want to go there?
Right. When he was killed.
Nobody's too busy.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
He squeezed money out of you?
No. Is he sick?
I don't think you can take it personally--
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
Could of been. That was white people's business.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
How come?
I see she built a place up here by the river.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
So what are we gonna do about this?
How long have you lived here?
Like your story is over.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Yeah?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
You're out early.
Uh-huh.
You think we need a new jail?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
You going to tell her?
Yeah?
Nix.
You ever been married?
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
Take a look at this.
Maybe they're not tricks.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Thanks, Billy.
D'Amour.
You did.  Didn't you?
Death.
Don't.
I'll tell you.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
He was the real thing, right?
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
What then?
What was that?
What the fuck?
Sure.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Whose is the car?
Any movie stars buried here?
Are you sure?
Who is she?
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I want to see Swann face to face.
You need an ambulance.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Look, Ma, no wires.
How the fuck do you do that?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Oh Jeez.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Call me tomorrow.
One question.
Have we met before?
He's not!  He's not!
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Hello?
Try twenty-five.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob Â Charlie Brown.
Charlotte, who?
Really?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
You made it.
Four.
Nice one.
It's bad isn't it?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to miss you.
Why can't it last?
Well... have a good flight.
Do you like massage?
Yeah, its really different here.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Hello?
Hi, Lydia.
Hello?
What?
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
I don't know what to do.
Like popcorn?
Yeah.
Will you please stop smoking?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
I miss you.
John! What are you doing here?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I'm still shaking.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Is he going to be okay?
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
May I help you?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
I do.
So what'd I miss?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
Yes, I know.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
There's nothing else here.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Oh, Peter.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You don't want to face it.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
What's this?
What's the matter with you?
She told me she killed them.
I hate it.
What?
What?
Yeah, you met her?
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
That's not it.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Which one for tomorrow?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
Coach...
Wait...
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Nah.
You might be the only one with a job.
That too tight?
I know...
This brother from my college.
You ever been in love?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
I know.  But chances are...
You shoot like a girl.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
You were trying to make me look bad.
But?
What's that?
So what are these Spanish guys like?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
I don't like flowers.
So?
What?
A ride home.
What's that?
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
You don't look half-bad.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Guess not.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
When'd you get this?
Forget Tonya Randall.
Kiss my booty.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
You weren't at my game.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
We're going to get some food.
You forgot to be there.
Stay!
So that's it, just forget about us?
What are the doctors saying?
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You asked me what was missing.
And what happens when you lose?
Zeke.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
Not great.
You hearing me?
Later when?
Quincy, please...
Why not?
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
So what are you gonna do?
What's Mom think?
What are you doing here?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Lucky kid.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
You ok?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
What kind of Cancer?
My mother had breast cancer.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
OPEN THE DOOR.
No.
No.
ok.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I lost my gun.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
It's ok.
You live alone?
-- can I get you?
Diet Coke.
-- what kind?
Where's Richard and Julia?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
C'mon guys, settle down --
Not enough, what do you want?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Did you listen to me?
What happend?
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
That's right.
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
I paid you back.
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
Get a girlfriend.
...cocksucker....
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
No.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
Where are you from originally?
And what did your parents do?
I'm sorry.
I wouldn'tve asked --
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
He's in here.
Is he in pain?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
You're just come in --
You're here.
I didn't do anything.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
Been drinkin' today?
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
I'm sorry.
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
How you doing?
You're my handsome man.
No.  No.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
Who?
No.
Two years...three years...
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Hello?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
You don't want any water?
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Yeah.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
The fuck is wrong with you?
Be ready at two --
Go to it, handsome.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
..sorry...
..sorry...
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
No, M'lady.
What -- ?
What is it, mother?
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
What is that?
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
And people close to him, who --
More wine!!
You can do it.
Now.  You were saying?
Poor Phillippe!
But --
Bloody hell...
A simple theological discussion.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
No!  Stop --
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Die?  What...?
D'Artagnan!
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
What is that?
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
A personal nature?
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Where is Michelle?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Did they kill him?
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
Did you know... about Raoul?
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
It's Marvosa -
Yeah?
What the hell happened?
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
Did you hit him?
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
And what did you do?
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Oh man...what happened?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Donut?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
Are you going to be alright?
I'm stranded out here.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
What?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
You look all right now.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
For Christ's sake, why?
Is it weird?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
What'd it say?
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
He's a very shy boy...
It's not over yet.
Will...?
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
Reba...
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you see?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Yes?
It's Will Graham...
I don't understand.
Do you know something about that?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
If I were?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Blue is cold.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Hello.
What's this Mama shit?
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
You went in the apartment?
She got all right?
What kind of coffee do you like?
Did you get my card?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Yes.
Do you have the file with you
Why does it feel good?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Andy?
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
My hair is coming out.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Really?
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Excuse me -- ?
Popcorn?
Why Memphis?
And all this will be for real?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Have you told your family?
You're NOT DYING!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
GET OFF!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
So?  What do they know?
Give me the book.
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
What's in Memphis?
Sure...
Bob Gorsky.
A -- a tourist.
Then the informant is real.
They are dead.  In either case --
You don't know.
The sewers.  Of course.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Don't be ridiculous.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
... yes.
Thanks... for the drink.
All right --
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
No way, no way, this is crazy.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
... am I dead?
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
And she's never wrong.
What did she tell you?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Tank.
That vase.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
But an Oracle can.
Go!
Is Morpheus alive?
What happened?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
What are you doing?
No one has ever done anything like this.
Neo, how did you do that?
Zion?
How much time?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Neo!
No.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
You flew before?
Hey, come on...
Waddaya think?
It's the truth, I swear.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Back so soon.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
Nope...
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Michael, give us a lift.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
Charlie, this is business.
Where's the rest?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
Bore.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Don't count it...it's all there.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Come on.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
How much?
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
-- But he does seem very nice.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Daddy!
What, honey?
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
I haven't been the father to you that --
What about the Mayor?
Yeah, but --
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Red or white?
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Drew, you're out of line.
I didn't say.
It doesn't matter.
No, I don't --
I'm not stepping anywhere --
'Yes'.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
I'm all excited --
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Is there any more to it?
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Why?
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
What are their feelings?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
That's it?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Well, I guess he's found one.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Yeah.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
But I didn't mean to do it!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
Obeah.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Don' be facety, woman.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
Susan?
Yes?
Joe --
I mean I appreciate that.
Where are you going?
'To bed'?
I'm sorry about --
I love your smell.
Where are you going?
But there's so much to tell you --
Will it?
The 'coffee shop' --
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
What a good idea.
When you go, I go.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Bill --
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Joe --?
How about giving a guy a break?
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Are you going to eat your lunch
You're violating the laws of the universe.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Thanks.
He is --
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
It just occurred to me --
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
What are you talking about?
About what?
'Take me'...?  Where?
'The one' to do what?
I'm sorry --
The 'question' --
I am, this is it.  B Day.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Drew told me.
Don't get carried away.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
You know each other?
What?!
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Nothing.
Where is he?
This is crazy --
I love you, Daddy --
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Nothing lasts.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
No, it was so right it scares me.
30.
Well, what then?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
You think you can bargain with me?!
Why?
Kill him.
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Who?
Neither do I.
I'm not.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Don't talk about my wife.
Calm down.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
Beer, please.
There's a dress code?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
This is your car.
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Who?
You really want to find this guy?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Why are you here?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
We've got to get him out of here.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Unfinished business.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
How do you know this?
You're not coming?
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
My wife wasn't diabetic.
No, you won't.
Your name's Teddy.
It is now.
What cop?
No.  I was in Namibia...
Yeah.
And...?
Oh, yeah...
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Yeah?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
How many?
My end?
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
Where's she now?
Your father?
Mojitas...?
You know how improbable this is...?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Would you find me...?
Yero, by himself?
You afraid of violence?
Packaging?
What's our deal?
What is it?
Stevens?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Like...?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
What's your take?
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
From whom...?
What are you talking about?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Alonzo...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
C'mon, man!
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
So?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
I think JosĂŠ suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
Conveyance?
That sonofabitch!
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
What...?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
What's in your socks?
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
I'm scared.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
These guys're good drivers.
I read it.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Sounds like they knew you.
You're what?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
Here. Don't even thank me.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Want me to take over?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
You know where they are?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
No, I'm not afraid.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Got a family back there?
What's your father do?
Girlfriend?
Just Erich.
Feeling all right?
What they give you?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
You got your stuff?
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
Whose?
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
I think I've been poisoned.
You're ayip!
Lady...
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
The Department of Public Health...
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
You feel anything?
The kid...
He's special.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Honey, just leave it.
Great crowd.
No, Jesus, no.
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
Oh, come on, come on!
Talk to me.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
This wing configuration. I've never...
What do you want to know?
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
No, what is it?
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Thank you so much.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
To Misery.
Well, it certainly says you.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Don't talk to me like that.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Stop--stop right here.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Marcia, please.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
I thought you were over it.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
Where is it?
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
You won.
You picked another winner!
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Fight a bit of a cold..
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
What you got there, mate?
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
We're due to take off.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Where's the bloody -
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
What's you name?
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Much.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Have you met them?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
I managed.
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
Are you okay?
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
What did you think of him?
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
I don't think I can get her to do it.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I don't.  No exactly.
..not in time to save him.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Come on!
To friends.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
WhatĂ­s Hunt doing on the TGV?
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
You were in the car!
There was nobody on the bridge.
Where were you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
The message is for Job.
May I come in?
I just need you to be safe.
What are you going to do?
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Kittridge.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
You're not going to any meeting without me.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Higher.  Higher.
Ethan.  HeĂ­s out of pocket.
Would you remove your hat please?
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Jim...?
I knew about Jim.
Why don't you take a look?
Thirty-two and change.
Try it again.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I don't wanna talk about it.
He got hit by a bus.
In a month.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Yes!
Why didn't he call himself?
This is good. Uhh...
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
She was right to leave me.
Stop it!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
I can't believe what is happening.
Loretta.
What?
This time I was trying to do everything right.
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
What?
You're making me feel guilty again.
I'm really afraid.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
I got things to do.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Will you marry me?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
What about the wedding?
Then let's set the date.
Yeah.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
What? He's in Sicily!
No.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
I... a... slept with my fiancĂŠ's brother.
I know.
Moving in?
So.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Who was that?
That's it! That's the reason!
Have you come to make peace with me?
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Then why are you eating alone?
Temperature's dropping.
I guess you can't invite me in?
People home.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Rita. Rita.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Cosmo.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Burn them.
I see.  Yes, of course.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Oh!
Oh!
Of course.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What word?
I move for no man.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Stop that.
Come Here.
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Who ... Who breaks out?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Ni, ni, ni!
Ni!
What with?
What?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
What?
Behind the rabbit?
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
The nose?
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I think I'll go for a walk.
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Do you want to come and have a drink?
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Until you, or anyone else ...
Well, look er, I ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Sir Galahad!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
... I Bet you're gay.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
Oh!
I done it again.
I speak as I find, Archie.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
She loved him.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
What are you doing?!
What's this?
It's what the maids are for.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
What did you say?
Gesture?
Mother....
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
By whose authority?
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
This is a slur on her good name.
Dare say you can be taught.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
You're injured.
Oh.
No loyalty.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Mr Brown.
Mr Brown.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
Well, both.
What's her excuse this time?
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Why was I not informed?
Unwell?
There is one other matter.
What do they want?
Ma'am?
Where is my son?
Does that thing work?
What's the riddle?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Dead?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Sick?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Nick...
No, in person.  Now.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
That's what I thought.
Alex...
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
The clock's already ticking.
It's here!!!
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
But I'm not broke.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
It's been a very strange day.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
So, what did they say?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
No, I don't.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
No, no, I'm fine.
Betty.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Was anyone hurt?
Number 17.
No ..........I.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
No.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
I don't know.
Mulholland Drive.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Okay... but just...just to see.
Okay.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
No, we don't.
Yes, Sir.
Yeah, what for?
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
Nice wallets.
Hardly.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
You must come in first place to move on !
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
First Bank ? But how ?
What are you doing ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
So why this ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
This is cute.
What are you DOING here ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
I thought you made this place ?
What's next Walt ?
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Stop the hydraulics.
When you are ready.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
That was rather.... disappointing.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
Zachary.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
So who are these people with the Boss ?
What is Bruce doing ?
Was that the Old Man ?
What the ... ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Really ? On a date ?
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
He was right behind me !
Good morning.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
Umm, where do you want this?
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
You want me to move?
Visualize a spare?
Seriously.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
There's still a big spot on the floor.
I already bought a ticket.
Yeah.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
What happened to Shelly?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Never heard of him. 
Sure am, who are you?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I'm glad you're here.
Do you have any pictures if her?
I'd say you turned out just fine.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
I guess you have.
Vada?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Thanks
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
There's water in your bathroom.
He said it was a gift.
Getting off please.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
It's dangerous!!
My mother stood on this very spot.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Write me a poem?
Muh??
What's that?
Wow!
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Then you'll be all set.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
I'm just tired.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Let me hold him.
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Arthur!!
Of what??
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Keep your voice down!
The boss is watching us...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Ex...ex, ex...
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
It's still available I hope?
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Kinda like men.
Home sweet home.
Dance with me?
I haven't danced in.....
Rock?
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Well, you were pretty great!
Can we see it from the back yard?
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
She likes to play bingo.
Are they ready yet?
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Hi Vada.
Really?
Do you miss her?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Sure.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Do you like her?
She's shy.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
I would.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I like my name.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
I won, I won!!!
How old are you?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
Thomas J?
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Hurry!
Is that your Dad?
Who's that with your Dad?
Can we go yet?
Woah!!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
What do you want it for anyway?
Come on, let's go.
Get up!?
I do, she's real funny.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Like this?
Close your eyes.
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
For what?
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Needs salt.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
We'll never be the same.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
You flew all the way h...
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Ben Gay.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I'm moving this book to Viking.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
But he sure can kiss.
And loving him means loving all of this.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
But he always says...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I saw the show.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I think he's been fired.
Well, you're a little early...
Well, sure.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Should I whistle down a cab?
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
Where did we first hear th...
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I'm up against a deadline.
This thing means that much to y...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
Michael...
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
This is her family and her fault.
I asked you...
What's up?
Why would she come here...
Almost three.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
It's not just a gag, huh?
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
You got the money?
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Then why are you listening to her -
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
What's wrong with her.
What did you say your name was?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You bet.
She's fine.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
His Word.
How is she?
He's going to run for president.
Well, how about the shopping center?
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
What's he running for?
You're kidding.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
You bet.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
You must really like him.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Have you seen a woman about so high?
She had on high heels?
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
You got a place to stay?
You in music?
We don't mess with accessories.
What kind?
I don't know his first name.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Bye.
When did you start singing?
How long have you been with them?
Hello.
I don't know who you are.
Stay.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I can do benefits
An album.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
I mean...
Hi.
Oh --
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
How come you never talk?
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Describe Mallory.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
And they made the first move?
Through the power of the simple word---
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Only on a much grander scale.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
You can't be serious?
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Who?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Rollin'...and speed!
I see.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Yeah.
Where' you goin'?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
Want to keep your job, boy?
Yeah.
What d'you want?
She done moved to Detroit.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
You working?
I'm a teacher.
In Birmingham.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Hell!
I wouldn't have let you.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Yeah. Well, I do.
What's he like?
Your boy.
What about that girl?
What's wrong?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Don't look so scared.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Don't do that!
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Where're you going to go?
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
Where' you goin'?
We was just leavin', fellows.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
How about a drink?
No.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Hello.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
So I been told.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Come on, Will.
Now you stay put!
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
What you lookin' for, mon?
Easy...
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
You ran without us.
Did you trace it?
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Hey, bro.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
Never heard of him.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
What are you talkin' about?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
What about the route to the core?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
You've been calling her name.
I gotta know... did it work>
How soon is soon enough?
That's not going to help.
I'm going in.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
He projects with neural implants.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
What's that?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Oh, man! Who told?
YOU DID.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Anita!
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
How about this?
What is this?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Uhh, no.
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Wow. This must be big.
Are mom and dad here?
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
I love the way she writes.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Yoooooow.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Boys.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Our penguin, right?
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I don't know.
Aloha! Welcome!
By name.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
He sure is big, Jack...
Taste it.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
You two got a thing going, or what?
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
You okay?
I figured you might like some help.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
What is this place?
Yeah?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
What is it - What's wrong?
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
What's so funny?
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Hi, guys.
Yor dad picking the music again?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
What's happening?
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
Are you okay?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
What are these, beauty marks?
You got five minutes.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
Anything?
Ms. Thompson.
This is nice.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
That's right.
I can't believe I just did that.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
What was that?
I could've saved them.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
C'mon.
Why is he after us?
We're here.
Hi.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Wait a minute.  What about me?
God, that's an enormous arse.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Busy tomorrow?
Whoopsidaisies.
I'm sorry.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Yup.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Wow.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
That's right.
Where are you going?
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
I agree.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Well, fire away.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Do you ever masturbate?
Buggered?
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
No, sir.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
What did she say?
Oh my God...  Hello.
Yes.
Yes.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
How was she?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
The one down your trousers.
Why?
M-m-m-ma'am?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Yes, ma'am...
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
On this ward?
Oh, I had them removed.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
I hope everything is settled.
What's your name, buddy?
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
That's okay, kid...
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
Yeah, kid?
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
What is it, kid?
In ya go...
What for?
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Yeah, where we going?
What?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
I'll bet a dollar.
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Lobotomy!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
So why are you talking to him?
It doesn't help him.
What's your plan, Mack?
You can come back later!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
'Kay, place your bets.
Jesus God...
You bet, Doc!
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
How do ya know that?
No!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Oh yeah...
You comin' in to hold my hand?
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Bet!
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
What happened?
What?
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Your mother.
Your grandmother?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Excuse me?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
What?...
You're sure...
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
We'll KNOW.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
How could you do this to me?
Are you okay?  You want some help?
To the foot doctor.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Why not?
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Nice dress.
So were you.
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
There's no such thing.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Very funny.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
I'll look forward to it.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Sure.
Faith, this is my mother.
I don't believe in statistics.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Is everything okay?
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Why don't you ask him?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
But what?
Kate, is something the matter?
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
You okay?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
So?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
You expecting somebody you know?
You think he misses me at all?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
He's heeeeeerrre...
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Why?
It was a ouija board, remember?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Who said I was going?
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Maybe I can change him.
It's siesta.
How old are you?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
And you didn't tell her?
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouthÂ
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that theÂ erÂ as you put itÂ main order of business?
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
But my own kid broÂ
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
MmÂhmmm.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the localsÂ you know what they're worth to us?
Âex-tanker who's walking on his heelsÂ ?
What the hell!!!
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell meÂ who?  -- who?
Father Barry.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
What?
What for?
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Wham... .
Were you really a prize fighter?
A dive? You mean, into the water?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
HisÂ racket?
You haven't finished your beer.
What are you crying for?
IÂ I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em AndÂ I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
It's true.
I've been sittin' in the church.
Told him what?
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
My hand.
Terry, no, no... .
Terry, for God's sake.
Thanks just the same.
But I feel likeÂ My friends won't talk to me.
Am I on my feet...?
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
Where you goin'?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to fingerÂ and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
What did you say?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
...walk?
You all right, Nolan?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Never will be much too soon.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
Better.
You was a Golden Warrior.
Is Johnny in?
No advice. Just whiskey.
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Count this.
My favorite little cousin.
IÂ I was just on my way up, Johnny.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
Yeah, yeahÂ Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
You don't think he'd beÂ helpful?
Maybe I willÂ one of these days.
ListenÂ NolanÂ
If I could get my hands on you...
Leave her alone, I tell you!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
What do you mean?
The ropes are coming loose.
That sudden?
You love me then?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
When!?
The moon is almost gone!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Oh, if there is only time!
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Oh, is this Adele?
Did you know that when you married him?
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
I don't know where he is.
It's Richard Ripley.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
Just that she got away.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Let's go to Detroit.
Outside of that.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You know they gonna set us up.
They found the safe.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
You talked to him?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Ironic, isn't it?
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Who was the friend?
Karen, I told you not to--
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
How much for your company at chow?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Good luck, Richard.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Boy, it stunk in there.
That's funny.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
You know who this is?
That's my dad.
Think I could have them back?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
You like bourbon?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
You're not dumb.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Whose blood you got all over you?
The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
The flight?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
And is Foley a part of this?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Right now, son.
That was some shit, huh?
How's it going?
You're a fighter?
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Flyweight.
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
You like to sit down?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Thanks, Dad.
Technically.  They're separated.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
How do I look, mama?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
We have a problem here?
I found a rubber.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
What lizard?
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Good shooting, Danny!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
I didn't mean it.
We gotta face some facts here.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
Get me into a plane!
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
Land of the free.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Yeah.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
So beautiful!
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
What?...
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Leapin' Jesus!
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
Welcome to the singles scene.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
I'll call you Later.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
What happened?
And we're here on the couch...
But you love me don't you?
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Looking good out there.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
You really love me, don't you?
I'm sorry Charlie.
Charlie. About last nights..
What are you doing here?
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
I thought you were...for a while.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Yes, sir.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
I beg your pardon?
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Thank God for that.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Hi, Dad.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Does everybody have to hear?
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Where have you been?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
What's up?
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
What a great kite.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Sort of.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
What're you doing?
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Like what?
What do you know about hypnosis?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
What's the matter?
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
That's Renee alright.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Hey! Where're you off to?
So where're we going?
Zowie...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Why not?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
It's weird...
How did it go with your father last night?
Yes!
What's wrong with your face?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
This time. What about next time?
Drew!
What's that mean?!
I'm not going to die.
Whatever.
Innocuous?
Kids are great.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
Who'd you get?
Find a lawyer?
PARRTYY!
Beckett?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
Except... you were gay?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Are you a good lawyer?
Do you take risks?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Yes.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Hello?
Were you recently promoted?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
We're going to draw blood.
A homosexual encounter.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Great.
How many gays do you know?
Since when?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Right.
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Not when I was in the Navy.
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
What? What is it?
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
What whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
Power cells.
But I just wanted to say --
What about her?
They're already dead. Get on board.
Just give me your hand.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
What, switch what?
And him?
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Better keep moving....
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
Just shut up, okay?
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Frightening thought.
One is all?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Suleiman!
"God is Great," yes?
A toast to whatever he just said.
What the hell are these?
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Not a star-jumper.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Seal the cave?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
As you wish.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Look -- she remembers.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
'Then how do you account for me?,
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
'I am not a missing link.'
How did it go?
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
He's trying to form words.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Who are you?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Gorilla hunters ...
What is that?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
One is in a museum!
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Sustained.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Tell him to pull back!
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Bunker...
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
I was wrong.
Dawn! That was it!
...beautiful night.
No, thanks...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
What we got here a crusader?
Merle?
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Vancouver, B.C.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think I'd like to dance.
Good evening, Miss.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Nice of him.
Want to dance?
Why?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
They're going to arrest me.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Cold?
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Yes, Miss.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Please answer my question.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
We try to be decent.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
But even if you were in love with me.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
Who told you my name?
What's this in favor of?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
The only answer I have for you.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
Passkey?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
Recently, then.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
What do I get for it?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
Right.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
I am a fool.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Now, you're being beastly.
No doubt about that one.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
I have a rough idea.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
What's this?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Right.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
To Ann.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
Good.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Now, top secret file.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
Perhaps I will, then.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Oh, I see.
What period?
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Hello, Jimmy.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
You're so famous now.
Don't point it at James!
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
And that's why you never went pro?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Thanks for stepping in.
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
How you figure?
One shot stopping.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
I can't do this.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Wild ride, huh?
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
How was the beach?
Good move.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Sorry.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
... so I started tailing him.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Time for lunch.
I know where they're going.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Nice place.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
What's goin' on?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
Mean anything to you?
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
What story did you give to Davis?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
You're looking well, Dutch.
That's over the border, General.
Mmmnnn...?
Where the hell is his body?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
Your uncle will like this.
We can reach an understanding on this.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
No, you look like a hooker.
Nice car.  Yours?
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
No, but it's getting there.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Always.
Uh-huh.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
What do you like?
No?  Why's that?
Three.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Did you buy some clothes?
The Rex.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Was someone rude to you?
Okay.
What about dinner?
You always been rich?
You still mad at'm?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fuck off.
What if I lose it?
I've never been on a plane before.
But don't they have it in English?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
Business.
You're packing.
What's up, where you going?
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Love this car!  Is it new?
You're being ridiculous.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Kit...
Yeah... I know what you mean.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
It was great.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
You bullshittin' me?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Niece?
I got a dress.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Then you would use your--
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Are you looking for something in particular?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
What is with you?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
My Westley will always come for me.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
Can you move at all?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
Probably he means no harm.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
The Man in Black?
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Inigo.
A book?
Oh no. No, please.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
What? What?
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Where's Fezzik?
What? What?
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Because I know something you don't know.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
I want to duel him left-handed.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
You're just stalling now.
Then make your choice.
-- get back, witch --
Think it'll work?
Guess what.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
What is that?  A handkerchief?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Yes, what?
What was I saying?
Yes, it's quite possible.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
It won't run a week!
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
I never should have listened to you.
Don't help me.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Vaaaat???
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Not.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Do it!  Do it!
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Get car.  Get car.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Nietzche...
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
No.
Cash.
I live there. Alone.
Of course not.
Now, look...!
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
I don't know.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
Yes.
Yes?
Is something wrong?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I ought to call the police right now!
You want me to stay here?
Where... can I stay?
It's been three.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
You can't go up there.
It's regular. Okay?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
The only girlish thing you have lost.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
I imagine so.
A man should have a hobby.
Except you.
That's it. 
In quite a hurry.
Wait a minute!
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Went out before service.
I'll take you to...
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Was that all?
You didn't find anything.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
You mean he doesn't work for you?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
No-
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
What's down there?
What is it?
That spoke to you?
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches LĂŠone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
What are you laughing at?
But what about lunch?
Why didn't you eat last night?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancĂŠe. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
But it was really my fault.
Let me go! Let me go!
Are you giving me this straight?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
I am right! I know I'm right!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What!
Let it go.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
He might get some publicity out of it.
That's what I said.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
What was her name?
What?
We flopped the first time out.
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
What'd you say, Brother?
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
He kissed her.
She's putting the titty back.
No, Mother, he's lying...
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
How goes it, darlin'?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Boys? You say to me boys?
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
Rose, what are you doing up?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Took your time gettin' here.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose, you don't have to.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I was going to tell him.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
And... ?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
What'd I say?
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
You shouldn't litter.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
Sons of bitches!
I can work this.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
That's them trying to kill us.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
What's the plan?
Dean Martin.
What day is it?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
He tried to kill us.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Can't I?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
What... ?  Not you too?
That's not true.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You need a doctor.
You get him?
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Been waiting long?
How'd we do?
What the hell's his problem?
We're screwed.
The gang's all here!
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
There's still good in him.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Yes, my Master.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Wouldn't miss it.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Proper?!
What did he say?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
Ugh!
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Then you know why I have to face him.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Told you, did he?
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Yes.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Maybe we could try it this way.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You did right.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Was all I had to say
Want to come again and stay
Feeling
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
...Guess.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
D'you really wanna call?
Why?
It's only temporary.
It's okay.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
'Bout seven.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
I thought it might be cute.
No... I can't!
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Oh, Rocky!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
Hear she's retarded.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Nine minutes!
Cost ya a buck.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
A hundred an' thirty.
That's it? -- Completely?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
What's happened is freak luck.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Wanna keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Hey --
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Help what?
How ya feelin'?
I got whiskey here.
Ya really like her?
What gaps?
Outta my house I want ya!!
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
You?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
Hold on a second.
Now what?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
You tricked me, damn you!
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Wrong number?
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Two bits.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
What the hell are you doin' in there?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Romeo! Romeo!
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
'Tis he.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Goodnight.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
I have.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
I take thee at thy word.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
That dreamers often lie.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Nurse.
It's under your seat.
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
What is?
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Lose them!
About time!
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Hazard pay...
I still am.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
Now, what did we steal?
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Are you alright?
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
Shut up!
Do you have it?
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
And more importantly --
So what do we do?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Yeah.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Created?
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
It's been known to happen.
They call me Swede.
Is that right?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Cigarette?
Same thing, isn't it?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
I needed to know.
How did you know?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
I'm going with you.
What's this?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
How could you have done that?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Not here.  They might see it.
Would you stop with that...
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
And now...
You son-of-a-bitch...
Why's that?
It's the Irish tape we want.
You slept with her!
Can you get it?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Oh, you would have done great.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
It's the right thing to do.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
I can't do that.
He's going to be trouble.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Well what are we supposed to do?
You're crazy.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
I'm all ears.
Well, I don't know...
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
So do I.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
And what's that?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Shopping here?
A lot of men come in here?
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  IÂd have found it in a minute.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Jesse?
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
It was going to be a surprise!
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Oh Jesus Christ...
Is that the mail?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
This whole place?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Not in the trunk.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
What the hell is that?
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
You lied to me.
What are you doing?
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Not Yu.  You!
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Is it hot in here?
What's she doing?
I don't want to hear this.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Vegas...
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
First class.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Do you still have the bills?
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Lee!  It's him!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
What is your name?
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
You talk very fast.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
That silly-ass look on your face.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
What about them?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Now, that's American music.
You know War?
What?!
Like that.
No, please, I don't --
I'm sorry, Lee.
How'd what go?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Jesus...what do you want?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Âem.
How much they want?
I'm talking about the girl.
Hmmmm?
You a cop or something?
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You sonuvabitch.
Yes.
Yes.
He is very good.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I will not have friends in America.
What is he up to now?
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
"Sink the putt."
"Nothing but net."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Fisher, let him talk.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Maggie!
Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's running after her.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Of course we are.  Of course.
And you are?
It's nice that they're still friends.
They made me put my hat back on.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
Give me that!
Too much.
Always a mood killer.
I'll have the same.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Yes I do!
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
About a minute...?
Yes, you!
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Yes, I did.
You were not.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Grandma!
Let's go.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
What?
A harmless joke.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Nope.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
Is that all right with you?
Even when you were young?
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
About forever.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
You okay?
What's with you?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Right.
What?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
Did you talk to him?
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, I know that part --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
It's you.
Which means --
Why not?
What are you going to do, Sam?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
And you're worried about him.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
When's the latest time you were out there?
It's Y. O. H.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
What?!
What?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
Will she scratch up your back?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I'm starting to forget her.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Dad!
It's a sign.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Did too.
When I found you?
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
You're kidding --
Oh.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Take a drink. Calm down!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Was it expensive, the beer?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
No ...
LuĂ­s! Come down here!
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
What?
What can I do for you?
What?
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
What is it?
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Fuck you.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
What are you hiding, Danny?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
What's wrong, Danny?
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
How you holding up?
What time is it?
My features. They're Finnish.
Finland is a country.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
What's this?
What the hell is that?
You don't trust me?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Not bad.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
You want to do this some other time?
Come on, guys ...
Shoot him.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Cool it. We got business.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
You've got no choice.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Excuse me?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Tom, quit fucking around.
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
We're in business.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
Resistance?
As a matter of fact, I am.
Jackson?
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Y'all come back.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
He ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
We left them eighty-eights.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
How about that jeep?
Upham?
Some.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
What'd you say, Captain?
Captain, what about our deal?
GO!
Beasley's dead.
Fresh out.
You think they'll be alright?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
Oh, yeah?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
What are we going to do?
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Huh?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Up.  We're moving out.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Maybe Caen.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Goddamn it!
I'd like to go, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Pardon me?
No, no he's not.
Hi.
Thanks, I like yours too.
Keep it.
Gee, it's easy.
That's unlikely.
That's not even a scam.
So, what's your point?
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Wait a minute.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
You like it?
I didn't think anyone would get it.
What are you doing?
What?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
You think you know what this money is?
I made their lives better.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Are you busy on Friday?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
I'll go.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
He does this every year?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
So what's your job this summer?
Then call me tomorrow.
Stop by later.
Okay, bye.
Yes.
It's okay, everybody does that.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
Are you comfortable?
Why didn't you tell me?
How do you know what I'm going to say?
Okay, what did we just decide?
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
It sounded like you did.
You shared it with a dick.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
YEAH!
What?
No, really.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
I know.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
Oh, I was just going to...
I love you man
Later for you, Luke.
Now you're back.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
What's your name?
You know what, you'd like her.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
You took my workers.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
This is not my problem.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
God bless you, sir.
What are you doing?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
What others?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
What?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
I'll talk to him.
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
They arrived.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
I can do it, Captain.
He's broken his pattern.
I heard a noise.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Hang up...call...
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Hello? Ted?
WHAAAATT?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
I couldnÂt believe you didnÂt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
I think he's doing Dolly.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
About what?
Where's Sid?
He seemed harmless.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
And now, drum roll please...
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. ItÂs been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
I never meant to imply...
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
You're getting obvious.
No, wait...
I donÂt know.
Time to change numbers again?
Can I come with her?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
And white.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Do you want to die?
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
Jesus.  Hello?
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Where are you?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Can I help you?
Nope.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
What do you know about trilogies?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
What do you mean?
Hmm.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Where are you Dewey?
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
They found another note?
Why would the police come to you?
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
Off the record.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Thank you.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
What's your point?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Who's phone?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Geez.
Possibly.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
You're not happy with your part.
Where?
Yeah?
Duh... that's quick.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Close call.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
I don't understand...
Hello.
Who is this?
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Just some scary movie.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Gotta go.
Listen, asshole...
Is this some kind of a joke?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
How do you know his name?
I wanna play a game.
No... please.
I don't know...
...please... no...
You tricked me...
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
He's not a suspect, is he?
What brings you out to these parts?
What are you doing here?
Any word on my Dad?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I was first to respond.
Jesus...
What's the plan?
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Many times.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
You're evil.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Can you see me right now?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Are you okay?
Have a good trip.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Stop. Right there.
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
I thought everything was checked out.
Yeah.
Why are they doing this?
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Thanks, Tatum.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Shit, what is he doing here?
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
TATUM!
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
How's that?
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
Already.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
What the hell's going on?
Where we headed?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
Here he comes.
You just met me.
Not here.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
There's a bucket here.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
This doesn't make any sense.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
No fingerprints?
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Are you alright?
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
What are you talking about?
He's preaching.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
No.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Tell me it's not true.
It smells good.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
But Mose Harper said...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
You askin' me to clear out now?
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
I say NO!
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Unnt-meah!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
That's what I said.
Keep talking.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Say it. We're beat!
Hey! What's the idea...?
Futterman?
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
Think she means for us to follow?
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Well, you're a widower now...
Lemme alone...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Comancheros...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
She's not a little girl any more.
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
They never find that girl.
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Where?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Who was that?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Who's that?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
No, I've never seen him before.
Mrs. Straub!
Well, look here!
NedÂI knowÂI know
How much?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Interesting.
No, your marriage bed.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
When?
I have a wonderful new play!
What's the title?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
So what do we do?
Where is the play?
No Juliet?!
Where are you going?
Nobody. The author.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
The daughter of his enemy.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
Two hours at prayer!
Be good to her, my lord!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
And--?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.

When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
I would not for the world!
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Better fortune, boy.
Oh my lady, my love!
You can bring them with a word.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
I do not know how to undress a man.
And that was only my first try.
There is time. It is still dark.
Then I will go with you.
Will! What--?
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
NoÂno.
"Âthou need'st not to be gone."
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.

But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lady Viola.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Good morning, my lord!
Wait there.
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
And her lips?
But what of Lord Wessex?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
I was trying to educate you.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
What do you think?
Alex, I don't have the time --
You mean immoral.
When are you going to let the police know?
I can't do it.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
I want to secure it.
Who?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
No. Why should it?
I've never seen any of these men before.
And you like it?
Did you know --
I thought you stopped going.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Who was it?
The man we know and love.
Know and love?
Hugo.
He's got a car?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
No.
I don't want to. It's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Later. But first -- him.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
You'll wait in the hall?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
What?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Two?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Who have you talked to?
We already know. All about it.
Eh, I don't know.
What?
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Hello.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
It's nice.
What's it about?
Do you think you could answer that?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
No. I haven't seen them.
Yes.
Diseases.
Offering it for debate.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
What?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
Why not?
What?
Yeah, I think so.
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
What about?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
Hi.
Oh, no.
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Chopped liver?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Yeah...
You are.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Pardon me?
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
Well, what do you think?
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Why not?
And?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
No! Don't! Please!
Don't do it.
-- you are.
-- sure.
-- very nice, very nice.
-- Jesus --
-- good afternoon --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Well then what are you trying to do-
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
So I'm saying it...
God, there's Lester...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- yes, George.
Not yet.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
There were some shots.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I just... who what?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
George --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
George?
George.
When is that?
What?
A friend dropped me off.
What business meeting?
Television or movies?
I've got to get her out of here.
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
-- and take this with you.
Baby, please don't... I love you.
How?
-- yes.
George...
Please!... that's not like you.
Yes, yes, I did.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
I wanna hear about it, George.
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
Why, why do you think that is?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
You really think so?
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
Awww --
Come on by.
You're home.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Yes.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
You and your touchy investors.
They get hair all over the place.
No.
Who are they?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Jackie Shawn.
I am? I mean why?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
Why don't you ask for another one?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Good for you.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- why?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- what's the problem, honey?
Are you having a good time?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Yes.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Room 237?
Yeah.
Jack...
Yeah.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Red Rum.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy!
It's okay, really.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Who?
A nigger!
How?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
I did?
What'll it be?
Any ideas yet?
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
What do you want me to do about it?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
I don't know.
Of course I am.
I just want to go back to my room.
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me,
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
five months of peace is just what I want.
Right there.
Thanks.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Are you all right, Marty?
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Rattling. Rustling.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
What is it?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
Yeah? Really?
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
But how?
LET THY SPIRIT
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
His ashes?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
Oh my! 
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Is this... choir practice?
Hold on.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Like this place?
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Is there any syrup?
Come on, we're late.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
The reason?
It has come to pass.
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
The vow of obedience.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Sometimes it's not enough!
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
He's a businessman.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
I am?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
I have?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Hey, girls.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Then one day they find you.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
Vince -- is she... okay?
It's done?
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Ice cream!
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
It's so beautiful...
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
I lied.
She's a nun, Vince.
She's... she's a nun.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Who took the meat?
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Your superiors are two days away!
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
The Widow Windsor.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
What was she doing?
This is farewell.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Other people?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
What are you on about?
Must I hear this?
And this gives worth to butchery?
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
What are you doing?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
What is so urgent?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Use caution.
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Can you help?
What... what are you doing?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She has confessed.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
You know what, by God?
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
Leave.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Stop it, Doyle!
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
You like that Vaughan?
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
You got that shit right.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
What's all them books?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
I want to be baptized.
Don't hit that boy no more.
But maybe just for awhile --
What are all them books?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
You want to go with me?
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Why not? It died?
Why?
It was alive?
What you readin'?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
It was fun, anyhow.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
A blister shore can hurt.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Do they know about you?
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
Do you have family here?
That boy wants me to.
Naw, I ain't.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Is he leaving right this minute?
I didn't mean that.
Where will he go?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Yes.
And your father? Is he from New York?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Not an easy book.
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
What do you mean?
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Hey, man, good to see you.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
You usually get two.
So. Are we ready?
I'm all ears.
Every word.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
I just want to know where he is.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Thomas.
Well?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Mostly what.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
That's where the what comes in.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Eight-thirty.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
How do you want that cooked?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Closer to eight.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
Did you write that column?
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
Greedy.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
That's when he fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
You must think I like losing.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Can I say something, here?
Are these your bags?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
We're not?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But suppose he loses?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Nellie told us about it.
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
You don't see any blood?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Done what?
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
Oh, he does!
And where's he going to be?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Oh.
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Anything wrong?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
No!
How did those holes get there?
We could pass for that.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
About that roadhouse -
Daphne...
You're leading again.
We'll adopt some.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
Anything today?
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
What's the job?
And you'll be in all evening?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
We got it second-hand.
Running away?  From what?
Put it here.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Afford it?
Brains aren't everything.
What makes you so sure?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your face is familiar.
Your view of what?
I'm not interested at all.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
- opening of the Opera -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
And you will come to hear us tonight?
You heard her - yes.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Love it.  Which way?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Look at all that silverware.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good evening, sir.
What'll it be, sir?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know what I love about all this?
Christ, Amy.
Wow. You look beautiful.
If Ed ever found out....
YouÂd better get going. My parents will be Âround to cart you off to the country.
Say something. Please.
WhereÂs Nick sleeping?
ThereÂs a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
I thought you said you were crap.
IÂll just check into a hotel.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Nothing, nothing.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hey, you!
Brilliant.
You think we look like weÂre trying too hard.
Mission accomplished.
Mmm.
What does your gut say?
Six thousand, right?
Not you. YouÂre not disgusting. YouÂre lovely. Just the idea that theyÂd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnÂt...who never.... I mean, someoneÂs dead.
Your ÂfriendÂ guaranteed my anonymity.
Would you grab my shampoo?
You shit!
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
ThereÂs a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
Come on.
And what if I didnÂt want you to...to do that to me?
IÂm sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
When I said IÂd never done a wedding before, I didnÂt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
And thatÂs when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Nice speech. I thought it was ÂtouchingÂ... and Âfunny.Â
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havenÂt visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Yeah.
IÂm guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
I am now, sir.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
Go on...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
Goodnight, Daddy...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
From Miss Johnson --
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Miss Boatwright --
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Did you see Daddy?
Good night, Mama...
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Whatcha got there?
Well, let me have it.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Is he gon' be gone long?
Whatcha wanta order?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
There, you see?
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Why the fuck not?
-no Cheesy Poofs.
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Suck my balls.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I can't believe he's dead.
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Mph rm rmph!!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Goodnight, honey.
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
What?
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Purpre mama!
Yes I am!
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
No... The General is right.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
What's a butfor?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
And Bill?
I'm needing lunch.
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
How is the children's progress?
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
What's going on Terrance?
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Did you see that, Wendy?
NAZIS!!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
My friend the clitoris told me.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
What is it?
I think we're moving.
Anna...
Jesus, come on!
Excuse me?
Oh, thank you.
Well I appreciate that.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
So...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
On channel 10?
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
You're certain of that?
So, are you on for the next one?
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
We're going to die.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
I don't know what we're facing.
Dawn!  Dawn!
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
Dawn.  Come in.
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
I'm fine.
No, just enjoying the view.
So I've been told.
I'm homesick.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
- canker sore.
It's a beautiful thing.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Buzz Fazeli.
Need some advice, huh.
Where'd you get this ball?
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
Theo.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
We ain't married no more.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I don't like to talk about it.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
After we eat, Dad.
Fantastic! What talent.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Get that outta your mouth!
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Kinda tough on the butt.
Where did your brother escape from?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
Why were you suspended?
Do you talk with your mom?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You told Junior that we did it.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
How do you get this thing down?
You should.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Sez you!
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Some unfinished business.
Very good, busyboy.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Fletcher, get away from there...
Norman!
Direction's east coming!
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Thirty yards.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Thank you, Colonel.
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
Anything else?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
What is it, Norman?
Picked up something?  What is it?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
You think he killed Edmunds?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
I see it.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Ted?  Captain?
You don't know that.
Gimme a report, I want --
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
She wired this system.
I'd also like it noted --
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
Look at this.
What's wrong?
We had considered it.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
From the sphere?
Edmunds?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Wait a minute.
What?  Why...
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
You don't believe me.
Page 87.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
Three to six hours.
It's getting cold.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Someone did.
You're lying --
You're insane.
I never went in that sphere.
Don't, Beth.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Beth!
How's that?
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
For who?  The fish?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Is it coming from our own computer?
Don't be defensive.
C'mon.
Nice work, Norman.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
What is that?  That noise?
You remember opening the door?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Beth left?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Did I kill her?
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
I can't reach her.
C'mon, Norman!
You know how to work this thing?
Well, press something!
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Well, if it's a discharge --
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
You've heard of me?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Try this one.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
How much do you think she's talking about?
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Who are you anyway?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What is it?
What about the princess?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Here come six more... grid two!
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
Who's the pilot?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
Well, I practice a lot...
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
Watch it!  Move back.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
No need, everything's under control.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
No!...
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
How do you make him do that ?
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
I don't believe it !
Please continue, Sergeant.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
So what are you doing later ?
I'm all ears.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Profile's wrong... there.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Good for you.
She's flying starships !
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
None at all... We won.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You talk to Carl ?
Do you mean it ?
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Where'd it come from ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
It stinks, you goin.
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
What frequency ?
Good good, then it's all settled.
...CUT OFF !
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
How bad are you, pal ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
The examination is a normal function.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Yes.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
<U>Computer off</U>!
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Hold station.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Evening, Annie.
You bringing your new friend?
You like my play.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
...who...?
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
<u>How</u>...?
Me?
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
It's for your finger.
Thank you.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
Hi.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
...and we could get up every morning...
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
What are you going to do?
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
Hi!
I have to tell you something...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Mornin', Doc...
He's on the ph...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
Waterford, Vermont.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
Bobby, don't say anything.
How old are you?
What else?
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
What I...
<u>Bobby</u>...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Get him on the phone.
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...I...
...I know...I know...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
And you know what...?
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
That's cor...
Why not?
What?
Doug, the traffic light...
I have to talk to you.
Arrest him.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
He didn't have to tell...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
What's in the case?
I had a witness I would.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
I...
I...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
We're out of money.
I know the feeling.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
I treated you like a son or nephew.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
Then you're finished in show business.
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
My oh my.
I'm gonna' bring it off.
It's just a formality.
Pay her off.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
I want them thrown in jail.
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
Like who?
I'm gonna call him.
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
I could help with the debate.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
You lost Ben?!
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
This is my house too!
Hold lunch!
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
That doesn't bother me.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Great.  Big ears, too?
I hate her.  I really hate her.
Excuse me --
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Where Ben?
Find the bird cage?
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
And when did that pass?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Which part of no don't you understand?
Something's up wi...
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
It's temporary.
Yet another spaghetti night.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
I have a snoop.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
However many.  It's not enough.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Did I hear the word...
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
She's devastated.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
But?  But what?
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
I needed some time away.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
Out! Leave the table!
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
But really, you never know.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
We're not ready.
Don't even joke about that!
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Sure!...
We did the same thing last year also.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
I can read it to you.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hello, Vi.
You're not.
You have beautiful skin.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
No.
OK.
I dunno...
Hello?
I believe it.
That's too bad.
Great. How old are they?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
OK. Bye.
Is it loaded?
What for?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
--be prepared.
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I have a lighter!
Enjoying the tour so far?
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
How goes the roll call?
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Drop the anchor!
Get your men to do it!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Yes!
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
What shall we drink to, sir?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
What's the target.
General, stick to the point, please.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
They can't touch us at this height.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
I said that's the point!
Who's that?
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
Mn-hm.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Yeah!
Typical male.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Yup.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Sounds like a bummer.
Yeah.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Don't let 'em fight.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Y- s-sure it did.
What?
She's dead?
Yeah, man.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Hey, man.
Am I fucking him?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
It's safe, come on.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You could do it.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
A Porsche.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
I know. It's okay.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Can you tell me what happened?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Jeff! Come up here!
Please?
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Yes, you asshole.
Of course I do!
Your completely missing the point.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Okay, what would you have done.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
What?
Come with me.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Wait, away?
Good, man.
No, it's not...
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Now?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Hey, where's Erica?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Get off my property!
Like?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I'm moving.
No, I'm going.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Is that Jeff?
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Yeah.
Your manager?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
So where are you?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
The fuck not?
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
I'm in, too.
Another sex dream?
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I sure do.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Shut up.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
You sure you wanna go there?
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
This is Miss Kramer.
Name dropper.
Hurt feelings department.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
I was afraid of that.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
Check.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
Hers.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
What's the matter, Norma?
We've missed you too, dear.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I wouldn't know.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
You're a writer, you said.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
We've made a lot of pictures together.
What month?
I want you to do this work.
You'll like it here.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
They've come for my car.
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
What are the notes?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
You'd better get to bed yourself.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
That's a lie!  They still want me!
You heard him.  I'm a star!
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Whose room was this?
What doctor?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Got a title?
Haven't got a thing.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
Paramount studios.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Maybe it was just an accident.
What's happening?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Like it?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
We're from different worlds.
Let me kiss you.
You're not afraid are you?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
I don't love you any more.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Hi.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Why should I believe you?
Nurse! Nurse!
Nurse!
No!
Why the empty cage?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I can do that.
Your hair looks the same.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
What's it like?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
Shouldnt've done that.
Others?
But it's impossible.
Yeah? What do you want?
Mr. Roebush?
Tuesday.
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Well, aren't you excited?
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
When?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Is this whitemail?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Anything.
Yeah? How's it look?
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
How you doing down there?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
No, we're just going down.
Who is she?
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
There's no rush.
I thought you'd never get here.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
I don't know you, lady.
Where's the light switch?
Oh, Superman!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Computers talk to other computers, right?
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
He's the only one who can operate this --
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Hostages?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I do?
It is kinda romantic.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Hi.
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
I'll try to remember that . . .
You do?
Gee. But --
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Superman! The --
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
What more?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
I've never been in a place like this before.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
And what do we get out of it?
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
What's he going to say?
What's that?
Whoa. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
What was that about?
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
Destroy Superman!
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
I know, but  --
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Not...gray.
Know what?
Big night coming up?
There weren't any wires. I looked.
What are you doing here?
You and your real estate.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
Nuts. He made it.
Mr. Romance...
Don't let me down.
You got wax in your ears?
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
It's a ...baby.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Well...flashlight?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Where do you hail from?
What's the matter, Otis?
I gave him this new face.
Please...
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Ally.  That's right.
Which one?
What...does it turn to?
I'm...so sorry.
I...don't think so.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
What do you mean?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
You want a cup of tea or something?
We've only got honey.
What happened to summer?
Is this mine?
From you?
Nicole!
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
That's right.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Dolores.
When?
Crafts.
Here we go.
Yes.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
I'm a lawyer.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Dolores?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Are you expensive?
What time in the morning was this?
Why were you scared?
You could see the speedometer?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
Will the police do anything to her?
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
But of course...
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Match me, Sidney...
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
How?
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
I don't think so.
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I can't
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Please... let... the kids... go...
Do you know about the chip?
No good.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
What does that mean?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Excellent.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Pain causes it?
Alriight!!  My man!
No!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
They took him from me.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
It's finally over.
Are you afraid?
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
And no elbows on the table!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I guess so, sir.
So, what does the Russki want?
What's that mean?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
What?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Let FurtwĂ¤ngler go. Please.
You live here, in Berlin?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
I can't do this. It's not right.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
How come?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Tough, tough!
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
What did Goering say?
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Then you are wrong.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Von der Null?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I have illegitimate children.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
How can I know such a thing?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. FurtwĂ¤ngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get FurtwĂ¤ngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Was looking at FurtwĂ¤ngler like that?
You were in insurance before the war.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. FurtwĂ¤ngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Great.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
You must have a girlfriend.
Do you understand?
You cold?
I caught one, back there.
You volunteered?
Good field-dressing.
Bag some Z's?
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Is this enough?
What's that?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
My whole life has been combat.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
So much pain.
And who was the enemy?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Here's her driver's license.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Send a unit.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
Do you know what to do?
You've got to be kidding.
Don't even think about it.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
You're the one who started running.
There goes a thousand dollars.
That one did.
What exactly do you do?
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
What are you doing here?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Do you mind if I sit?
Take the picture out.
No!  I'm sick of this...
What are you doing... ?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
Then, what good are you?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
What did you say?
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
All I mean is... someone like you...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Originally, Connecticut.
No.
Hey there, Nickie.
I redecorated.  What about you?
For you.
Call that number.
Tell me where we're going.
What are you doing?
It's them.  They did this.
Do you know how to change a tire?
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Physical?
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
Drive in.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
I need the police.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
You did?  How is he?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Goodnight.  See you home.
What's the trouble?
The Hinchberger wedding.
I don't like her.
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
Attractive...
What's happened...
How concerned should I be?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
That could have been worse.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
It's not going to hold your weight.
You're not telling us something.
Nell --
It's still an electric shock!
Are you working with her?
All the carvings.
Are you coming to confess?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
This is where we're going?
What happened?
What do you want?
Why do you need a chain like that?
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Not really.
No.
Jeez.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
Watts?
David?
Why?
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm not.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Hey.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Man knows what he likes.
I didn't expect anyone.
Boomerang.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Huh?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Didn't get it.
How d'you mean?
Here, are you always this sarky?
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I might've been away for the weekend.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
I see.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
I guess you're just habitual.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
Fancy it?
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
So what's your beef, pal?
Of the deal, man.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Been away a lot.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
How we gonna get that lucky?
How'd you get in here.
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Thanks.  You, too.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
But more or less.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
...I guess I've been all wet.
...Mm.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
She's a rare one.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Uh-huh.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...What kind of man *are* you?
What kind of man *are* you?
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Honey.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
How did you get into the store?
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
Yeah.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
...Probity.
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
...Huh?
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...Ed?
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
...You sure, Eddie?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
Hello!
Second chair.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
Forget it!
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
What happened to them?
I think I should come with you.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
What happened?!
It's still back there!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What's that?
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Dr. Frock?
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
That's impossible.
Mbwun.
What kind of egg is it?
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
How did you know that?
My God.  Then it was an animal.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
What happened?
Then it won't go after the others?
Help someone!
You smell that?
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
Why is he in the basement?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
What happened down there?
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Are we talking Emmies?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
I have a map.
The memory of who?
Lauren, right?
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
No.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Where have you been?
It'd be an adventure.
What did you want?
What do I do?
--we need more charcoal.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
How's your hip?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
Now what?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
What is it you find incredible?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What was it?
You didn't know my father --
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Mulder...?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Scully...
You're... quitting?
I wake you?
What kind of infection?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
Where would they be going?
What do you think it is?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Scully --
Cold...
I can't go any farther.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Where's Scully?
Why are you telling me this?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
More concerns than that?
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
Sing a song of sixpence...
He hates me.
She adores you.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Nothing.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
They're hungry.
You liked him?
What about narcotics?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Is she alright?
That's a secret.
I need it.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Thank you.
You were awfully good.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
No.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
When...what did you do?
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's go away.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
Are you going, too?
...Headquarters.
Harry.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Oh, well.
...anyway?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Nichts danke. Kein.
That's the reason.
Do you know this man?
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Him dying like that.
Listen, Callaghan.
Miss Schmidt.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Well?
Next, Paine.
So would I.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
This is where he vanished.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
It wouldn't work.
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
What time is it?
You do!
Zane Grey.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Striptease, sir.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
...your address?
...the best way one can, you know.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Yes, it is.
Oh, you did.
Harry...
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
Should I make it all fact?
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Big?
He tried to borrow money from us.
But he has been there, off course.
One kilometer
Bonsoir.
Hi.
Francoise -
I think so too.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
We lost our key.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
No one follows that midrash.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
You coming?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
How come you know all this shit?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
You're not in school? What do you do?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Are they still together?
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Bigger and better.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
What's it about?
Why should I submit?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
I didn't realize you cared.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
An investment banking house.
You wouldn't announce it?
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
And? WHat did you notice?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Give me a reason not to.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Explain it so I can.
I don't think you know what you are.
Who killed Manzetti?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
It was a nine millimeter.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
Think about your father. Your sister.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Balint?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
How have things been going?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Tell it to Hitler.
Hello...?
Isn't it true?
Who knows what that is?
Mrs. Moebius.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
How?
Where do you think you're going?
Howard Stern.
Adam Sandler.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
What do you mean?
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
What's happened??
Good afternoon.
You're right.  You're fired.
He seems to have won it.
I tell you she's mine!
You know each other?
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Where did you two meet?
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Is it a poem?
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
Because you'd laugh.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Is he alright?  What happened?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Roberto?  How long?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
What about the shoes?
Enzo, wake up!
Is he here?
It isn't lit yet.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
... What's your name again?
And where did you say you were from?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Why?
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
Well, what are they?
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Why?
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
Good night.
You still collect them?
Can I come in?
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
... How long was I asleep?
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
I recognize you.
But what brought you to Sicily?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
You jumped in?
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Where are you from, Henrietta?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
... And those?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
There won't be any need for that sir.
So. Do you have a name?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
What!?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
What are you doing?
Hammer, you alright?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
I wasn't too over the top?
You okay?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and Â-
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
This is for "mama and the kids."
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Sure!
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
I want him to lock me up.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Something black Â- something on its way to you ÂÂ
Love is different for different people.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
Come to look around?
Yes, but what sort of a man?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
That was unfortunate.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Wait ÂÂ
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Get it out of here!
On his back, I suppose.
No Â- not yet.
What did he have to do -Â look at the body?
ÂÂ	As long as my feet held out.
I can use them.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I got into a little crap game.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
We stood here once before.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says Âclosed to the publicÂ, doesnÂt it?
Good afternoon. De MoraesÂs residence.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I found this at your brotherÂs.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You donÂt mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is heÂs either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But IÂve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why IÂm here at such a late hour. I need Ĺ20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
I canÂt tell you that yet. But heÂs being well looked after.
How dare you...  You donÂt know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
No. The question now is how long itÂs going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. YouÂre fired, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
I still donÂt buy your story but I figured it canÂt do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
When did you get back?
Black suits you.
IÂve had a long and unpleasant day. IÂm tired and IÂm angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid LeonÂs boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havenÂt you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
One just doesnÂt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I donÂt.
Five years of it. Surely, youÂd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
You know something? IÂve just seen so much ugliness I donÂt think IÂd mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  IÂd hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thatÂs the way you want it.
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
So you did talk about it, huh?
The word for those things is croissants.
I canÂt believe this...  WhatÂs coming now, eh? If I donÂt pay all HellÂs gonna break loose, is that it?
You donÂt know why heÂs come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Right... Well, IÂll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
What am I to do with the packages if...
Then find another way.
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
So, what are you looking for?
IÂm afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Ever seen him before?
Where?
And who does Friedman work for?
WhatÂs the Ambassador?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Hello, Jane. ItÂs me.
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Any friends?
The Ĺ1,000 is on account.
Vous Ätes FranĂ§ais?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
YouÂre out of your mind. WhatÂs the idea?
What is?
Trying to say something, Martin?
ItÂs about the puppy. You got the money?
Leon? No. IÂm afraid he left.
IÂm sorry...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
WhatÂs a French private investigator doing here?
You thought wrong. I havenÂt seen Leon for months.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you heÂs terrified of men, so...
He just said he had good reasons.
ThatÂs what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnÂt take on another child, that heÂd get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnÂt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think heÂs back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peopleÂs minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not LeonÂs. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Is she on the phone?
I canÂt think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. WhatÂs your sisterÂs number?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Fine...
Huh... I guess you ainÂt quite ready for civilisation yet... IÂll give you one more day, a meal, and then youÂre on your way.
Mon bureau coĹątait trop cher.
Alors?
Gluck.
When they realise IÂm missing...
Mossad?
What do you think?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
What do you mean?
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
I would like some fresh straw.
And I would like to see a priest.
I thought you were an archer?
Who do they think I am?!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I'm already free...
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
Really?
Quick -- hide in here...
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
Trial?  What trial??
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
How old are you?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
Please... may I have it back...
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Get them out of here!
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
Does he have hair?
5,000 gold crowns.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Wait, wait...
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Besides, what about these...?
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
What signs?
No.  That was a sword in a field.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
Only God knows the answer to that.
I want to be with him always...
Someone you know?
A beauty. Who is she?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
Sit.
I need help.
Will I still be able to play?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
For what? For my tie?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Calm down, what, what is it?
wish I knew you better.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Boys, boys...
They bombed us, we're off the air.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
That's better than yesterday.
I know.
It's not funny.
I can look after myself!
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What are you reading?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
What the hell are you doing?
What's all that gunfire?
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
Yes, why not.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
You have to wash them.
She wants to see what you can do.
Everyone has to practice.
What did she say?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Play a gig.
Mama.
Which way are the rooms?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
You got a bag or somethin?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late.  Where you been?
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
I thought you blew all your money.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
I'll take him anyway.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
How'd ya do?
Everything go all right?
And?
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
You beat him, kid.
You wanta wait for your share?
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
See and raise five.
See and raise 1,000.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Hooker!
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
What do you mean?
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
Get on with it then.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
You got nothin' on me.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Why not?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
What?
And don't ever try to see me again.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
Mother!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Your father?
Come on in.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
She fell down.
It's been the same one for three months.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
How's your brother?
You can take that out to the car.
Shrapnel!
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
This gun yours?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
What about this Nunheim?
He's holding out on you.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Good morning --
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
Have a shot?
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I know.
What are you going to do?
Why, you said...
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Oh, he's sitting up.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
You don't say --
How are you?
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
I've never heard about you.
All right - you didn't.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
What's that?
What hit me?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Where did you get that?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Good. I want to talk to you.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Finished with these?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
What are you going to do?
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
I wish you'd tell me who.
Is that true?
Why are you saying it?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Trying to put it off on her?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
You his wife?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Where are you going?
Home?
Paper.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
What?
They shouldn't have been here.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
Where'd they go?
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
Epps!
What about it?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Invest it.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
Steady it out!
What do we do with the Humvee?
You didn't step on any mine.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
It's a mine, isn't it?
There's a way.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
This.  Whatever it is.
I don't hear any--
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
Why do I have to stay down here?
We should head Northeast.
First Wes, now you?
Sorry.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
And then shoot them.
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Epps?
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Australia.
Woods.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
At-at-at-at-at.
We...we could go home with something else.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
If there's gold.  If!
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
It's got a bottom.
I think he wants something to drink.
You're going to burn up in those.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Stress category.
When?
I don't know.
I have to... he's a G-34
I've never been under the table before.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
What are you doing?
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Are you all right?
They're watching us now.
no...no, no.
I thought you were through with it!
What?
Why did you have LUH come here?
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
May I help you?
And you are...?
How's the print coming?
What're you talking about?
What was-? Why...?
Now wait just a fucking-
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Why do you do it?
It's working.
What's up?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
More metal... sharp edge...
What's wrong?
What do you think?
Bev, you're the greatest...
Jesus...
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Then why tell me?
What is that?
Alex, please-
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Reilly, Vice. I-
Make an appointment.
A what?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
What?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No.
No!
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I don't want to see you at all!
Two weeks and three days.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
Yes, m'sieu.
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
The tennis player?
Disappointed?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Monescu!
Two fifty-three, five--
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
ĂysĂŠe seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
Then you go into the foyer.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
Yes.
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
It's disgraceful!
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
Then why do you want to go?
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thirty-three--
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Instantly.
Lovely.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
I think you'd better go.
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Good luck to you, Rose.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
None of the stewards have seen her.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
You told me to change.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Is this in any way unclear?
This should be amusing.
The boats are all going.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No you won't.
The fall alone would kill you.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
And these were drawn from life?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
A whole ten cents?!
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Jack, must you go?
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Where to, Miss?
You're trembling.
You have to go for help.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Yes sir.
April 14, 1912.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You'll excuse me. 
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
You're coming back--
Could I see you a minute?
Nice lines--
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Tell me.
When?
Thanks.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
What, again?
How well do you know her?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
You don't think--?
This is a business trip!
My change.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Come in! 
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
I'm going to the show--
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
How about you?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Here's your fifty.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
That's me!
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
I didn't--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
I don't get the humor of that remark.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
What's the matter, Mary?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
With your dry wit and humor--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
--you'd go with him!
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
There you are, sir.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Ain't got time.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Listen, I want to talk to you.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
I asked where you got him.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Don't touch me!
You really look awful.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
What can I get you?
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Well hello, Sherm.
What'd you do that for?
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
That thunder's sure somethin'.
I just got it fixed.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
But -
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'd rather die alone.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Yes -
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
His newspapers?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
I got you covered.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Married?
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
I'll keep that in mind.
- Shut up!
No?
Do I have to do everything around here?
... Do you have a gun?
Not a lot of difference.
Down?
Sleep well?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Who's in charge here?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
Is the helicopter ready?
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
I'll drive her to the hospital.
It was nip and tuck.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
What is that?
I could swear I heard my son call me.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Your feet are cold.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Since this morning.
What did you put on it?
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
How is everybody?
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
How many people do you all feed?
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
When did you talk to Harry?
How are you?
Yeah!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Yeah?!
Right here in the van.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
What are you doing over there?
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Toy?
Can!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
I could have stopped him.
According to my nava-computer, the --
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Come on, this way!
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Hi!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Hey!!
No she's NOT --
Laser-envy.
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
This is ludicrous.
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
I can't hold on much longer!
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Stop it!
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
What?  What is it?
Why does he need money?
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
This is different.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Where are you going?
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Is this bad for him?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
...How old are you?
Parents still together?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
Chill out --
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
Are you getting this on tape?
What do you think she wants?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Arizona.
David --
Yes.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
I don't think you're going to do that.
You first.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
A group of us are going out tonight.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
You should feel good about this.
One question.  How did you find about this?
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
Did you tell him?
Well, I've not brought them.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
For fuck's sake.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Sorry.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Following the game at all?
Thanks, Mark.
Good luck, Spud.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Running time?
You don't know, do you?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Why?
What?
But you don't have the money?
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
Excellent.
Great.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
It's the great outdoors.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It could. Yes.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
No, no, it's not possible.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu, what are you doing?
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Shuttle en route.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
No, but you can bet they will.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
What is it you seek?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Ah, Captain?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Yes, Captain.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Be one with the horse.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
...mark two.
What is this?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
What have I done?


Borgus Frat.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Each man's pain is unique.
Sybok.
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Your old files -- ?
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
I'm your program?
You said it.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Who is your User, program?
Well, isn't it -- ?
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
Then...
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Watch it!
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
But-what if I can't...?
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Nice...
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Harry!  Where are you!
What's this for?
What a team.  See you at eight.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
She's still at my house.						*
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
My husband is a good man.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
And you still reach for your piece every time.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Yes.
Uh huh.  Okay.
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
17 years.
Do you still love me?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Worse than Cairo?							*
That was you?!
Were they trying to kill you?					*
And you chased one?
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Who is this woman?
Not yet.
Tell him we gotta go.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
Ask me them again. One by one.
I don't remember.
Turn-offs?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
She OD'd, didn't she?
You mean she got a bad batch?
You're a whore?
Who?
You have a pimp?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Yes.
I do.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Wannabee nigger...
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
That's a pretty amazing story.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
I'd fuck Elvis.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
No. No, you don't.
He wants to talk ya.
Say it, goddamn it!
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
I really don't know.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I've seen him.
What are you talkin' about?
I don't believe you.
Come again?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
He knows.
What was I sayin'?
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Preach on, Big D.
You gotta hold this for me.
Yes.
No.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Well?
Women will want to get to know you...
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
That's him.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Change what?
Do you know why you're here, James.
Do you know what year it is?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
JOSE!
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
You have him in restraints.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
He no!
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
Can I help you, sir?
But, in particular?
Where in Mexico would you like--
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
One way, or round trip?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You want somethin'?
Will he be back soon?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
What time is it now?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
What was that all about?
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Jake, what is that?
Do you have to call me that?
Jesus.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Thank you, John.
Least you can leave.
Where you coming from?
Where'd you learn to do that?
All right, Grace.  No more games.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Have you ever been there before?
Jake.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace . . . Grace?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
John . . .?
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
Well, nothing.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Hey!
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
The time wasn't right.
You think that's a lot of money?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
Not from where I stand.
What are you babbling about?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
I asked you a question.
I want to stay.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
I wasn't doing anything.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Christ, I don't believe this.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
No police.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
More or less.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
What the fuck do you want?
You've got to be--
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I'm not rambling.
You meant it.
How much could you get?
I came for Grace.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
What happened to your hand?
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
But he's dead.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
So?
Great!
Twenty-after-ten.
Hey.
Hundred-fifty.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Nice place.
What do you do anyway?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Are there snakes out here?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
You love him?
Is that why you're with him?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
I wanted to talk.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
The money's right here! Get the key!
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Morning, officer.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
What'd you say to me!
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Morning Grace.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Who was that on the phone?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
...I think rust.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
Why?
You've never been sick?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Yes.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Yeah?
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to work out.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
No Jeremy.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
How are you feeling?
Where were you sitting on the train?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
He said...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
Free ones?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Yeah. See?
Yeah, I guess.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Books. He's my biographer.
Mmmm pistols.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But... if he doesn't miss?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
What?
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
He's... he's dead.
A sign on him?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
N-no, sir?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
He said that, huh?
What for?
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Get some sleep, Kid.
Did you kill him?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Is it him?
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
Take a drink, Kid.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
She gave me the evil eye.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Shit.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
I seen him.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
Three.
Did you... did you... ?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Well, suppose he does?
That ain't what I mean.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
There was ninety-one million -
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
You heard right.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
I was out of line.
I'11 be alright.
Three million?
No killing?
Let's say for example -
with what?
What about Redfoot?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
We're on vacation.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
So this lawyer...
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
How good's your intelligence?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Yes.
What is the truth?
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Say it.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Objection!
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Neurology?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Mr. Concannon...?
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Just now...
I do.  Yes.
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
What is this going to cost?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who are you protecting, then?
What is it?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Hello, I'm calling from...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
D'you find an apartment?
Maybe I can do something right.
Why don't you get some rest?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Not if you don't grow up...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
You're pressuring yourself...
Uh ...
... now who is that ...?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
What the hell are you doing here?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... I understand ...
... I understand ...
I just saw her.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
What did she say?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
And you like it.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
How often does this happen?
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Yes.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Nothing.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
You.
Will you have dinner with me?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Mmm.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
I like that one.
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
We're going up the tower.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
What are you going to do?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Wandering about.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Would you like some coffee?
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
Do you know where you're going?
How can you be sure?
What are you thinking?
And no birds sing.
Would you like a drink of water?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
What do you remember?
There's a name on the gravestone.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
No, don't go away!
Tell me.
You believe that I love you?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Ow!!
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well?... what'll you do?
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Johnny!
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Around.
What I've been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
The stripper's here.
I have plenty of friends.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
What are you doing?
Just stop.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Sun rises at 5:52.
So that's what we're doing.
We have to get going.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Are you solid with that?
I won't do it.
If anything ever happens to me...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
She's not here.
That's right.
I don't think so Boyd.
He's right.
I got her arm.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
What kind of words?
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Boyd...What have we done?
What?
Regarding what?
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
The hell I did!
Nope.
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
Then what do they have?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Easy Micheal.
What else have you forgot?
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's weird.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Time out.
We've got problems here.
Not padded ones.
I need your help.
Take care of those chairs.
Will you please call the chair people?
That's sweet.
Yeah. Nesting.
No way.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
You fucked a prostitute?
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
He kept saying he was protected.
What?
No...
But...
Just kills me...
That's just insecurity.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
I'll take a ride.
I'm getting married...
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
That ought to be about the end of that.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
Right.
Are there many windows?
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
You have no feelings toward ...
What do you mean?
Never.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
That's fifteen by seven?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
Me?
Why the bad temper?
How in hell does it wind up?
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Yes. Why?
Don't say that.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
You cannot leave ...
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
What's going on, Moncho?
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
Mother?
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
What about you, Manuel?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
You all right?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested ÂÂ all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -Â only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
You've had a yearÂandÂaÂhalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
HEY!!!
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
... and you get nanoÂdeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Should I have?
It was you, wasn't it?
I am beautiful, aren't I?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it ÂÂ I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonÂof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
What does that mean?
What did you do to those people?
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Which way?
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
Find out anything?
My guess is dead.
The symphony of collision...
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
What are you saying...
It's the White House.
What about it?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
No, this is great.

Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
Whaddaya think?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
How much...?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"

Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
What the hell...
The stock's going to Pluto!
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
...Got a 100 on me, you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
I don't know anything!
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
So what firm you with, pal?
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Know the name?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
What the hell do you want?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Hello Bud.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I don't.
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
He did?
Yeah 
What's that?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
We're all here, and ready sir!
She went to a waxwork party
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Well?
Well, it all started when a friend and I
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Anyone else not coming?
This time I really don't see anyone man.
No thank you sir we're fine.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Do you have a scarf?
I miss you.
What?
I didn't want to come.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
What?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
No.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Of course.  You must be so proud.
How're you holding up?
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Yes?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
When...when will she be back?
You're the flower lady.
Tell me.  Please.
That's not...It's not like that.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Would you like some iced tea?
No.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
He was so pissed.
She got it.  Turned it down.
How you holding up?
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Oh...
Are you okay?
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
I don't know.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
What's their name?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire?
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Wanna fool around?
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Get down!  He'll see.
Dressed?
When?
Are you lonely?
How do you know this?
Who did?
Sabotage?
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
Do I have everything?
What?
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
I may have seen her on campus.
The...
It's Madison Fra--
I don't like this, this...
Your wife...
"You know..."
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
Mmmuh...
What?
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
What have the witches always asked of you...?
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
Who is this...?
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
I don't want the -
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
uh - then he - be just -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
They like you ------- kids.
My jury's still out on that,
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Hey - you're bleeding.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You alright...?
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
Something's wrong with you.
He's got great hands.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
Which do you think is her best shot...
OH MY GAWD!
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
So there is only one key...
And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
I lost the touch
Do you take sugar?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
So what do you do?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
then why did you marry her -
And how did it feel to be rid of him
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Where are you going?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
Don't you want me now LESLIE
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
What happened?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Dr STECKLER?
Dead?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Sugar?
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Who the hell was your father?
So far away? In Xenia?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
You're late, bro!
You'll never believe who's in there.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
You go first.
And I was wondering.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
You're way ahead of me again?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Finally, some gratitude.
You do know how to drive?
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
The one with the horses.
Teddy? I was thinking.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
My legacy.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Me?
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Why can't you be nice to me?
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
My father must've been amazing.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Bad news.
About Suzie?
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
You mean he withdrew...
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Maybe she used another name.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You saw the news today?
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Where's the body?
That bothers you?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
About a year ago.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Why?
I want a full-scale investigation.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
This wasn't my idea.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
It's those rocks, up there.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Excuse me?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Okay, what's the matter?
He... Sam Lombardo?
So, where you off to now?
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
But check this...
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Where is she?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Sam...
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
J. S. Bach.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Limestone quarry?
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
That's a lot of butler.
Now, what was that?
All that jumping and kicking.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Jim, are you all right?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Know what this is?
There's only seventy-eight.
He's not giving up?
A new friend?
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
She's perfectly safe.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Now it's a bomb.
I beg your pardon?
When are they coming?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Because it's true.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
You all right?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Because she's sick.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
You?
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
How am I gonna do that?
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
She needs to be changed.
She's hungry.
Talk!  Say something!
Hey, careful there!
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Nail it!
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
Don't let them hurt you.
Amish.
So one of them got to him.
You know who?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Who else knows?
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Where are you taking us?
Oh? Anything else?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
Who are they?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Enjoying your reading?
Buttons are Hochmut.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
We had some lemonade and he left.
Sure.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
It's me.
I'm coming.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
God, Fred...
Is the English dead?
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
...have you come back?
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
...didn't you?
Ahh!  Ah!
Toto's my dog.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
...her face is careworn.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
...room --
Oh -- 
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oil can.....Oil can....
Where do you want to be oiled first?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
We might.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh, my!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Who's her?  Who's her?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
They're coming back!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
...don't talk.
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Yes -- there --
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
...ting the ruby slippers?
Real courage. That's what we want.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
What happened?
Up!
Where -- where do we go now?
I haven't slept in weeks.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
You don't get around us that easy!
... about Dorothy.
To Oz?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Come on -- come on --
Let's.
It's a whozis.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Stop that dog!
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Zukovsky...
WeÂve got to get out.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  IÂve known that girl all her life. IÂm not sure she knows what sheÂs walking into.
You havenÂt been given an assignment in this case.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
The name?
Revenge isnÂt so hard to fathom. WhatÂs clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Consider me ungrateful.
He was my father.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
You donÂt take no for an answer, do you?
What is it?
I understand itÂs normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
I donÂt know what youÂre talking about!
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Since I was a child, IÂve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnÂt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
So you killed your father.
Was this all about the oil?
You, of course. I need some information.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
I thought you were the one in her business.
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
The MaidenÂs Tower.
What is this place?
Do we have the range of RenardÂs plane?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Why?  What's the problem?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
A whore fucking.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
What -- am I --
ItĹĄs very strange.  TimeĹĄs flowing backwards . . .
Jon --
No.  I just wanted you to --
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
. . . What?
-- What is it.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
What the hell -- ?
They're following us.
What's he doing?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
What new information?
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
What happened?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
New information.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
What do I get out of it?
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
How will you fix it?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
I was invited. What's your story?
Who are you?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
Where are we going?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Where's he headed?
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
I think I'll hang on to these.
What...?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
What's so damn funny?
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Very nice. I'm impressed.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
I'll tell you one thing though.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
He's uptight.
Logan, do you see this ring?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
What are you going to do?
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
The point of what?
You designed this yourself?
Don't you knock?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Is that what you're looking for?
I'll find him.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
Oh, shit.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Darling!
Darling!?!
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
There seem to be quite a few books.
How long will this whole thing take?
What?
Vermicelli.

Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?

More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
You can't win 'em all.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.

Did you have a pleasant trip?
Are you busy?
Inga, wake up!
