That's because it's such a nice one.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Tons
I was?
You always been this selfish?
What good stuff?
No.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
What do you think?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
You're welcome.
But you hate Joey
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Why?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Dead at forty-one.
It's her favorite band.
Don't make me do it, man
She's partial to Joey, not me
You get the girl.
Not at all
Away.
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Do what?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Block E?
William would never have gone to a state school.
That's never been proven
I didn't have a choice.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
What?
What are you doing here?
Look up, sunshine
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
No one else knows
You know what I mean
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I thought you were punishing me.
So what I want doesn't matter?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Yeah...
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Make anyone cry today?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I know.
Thank God...
I don't want you to wait for me.
Not bad.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
... for a commoner?
What...?  Do I have so many already?
He understands.
You did the same to your God!
You never learned how to speak my language.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Passion is something one cannot control!
Damn God!
Colon!  Don't!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
What did they say about Granada before today?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
My horse doesn't work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Then why?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Yeah, right.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
When?
A timer.
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Did you tell him you did?
What are you saying?
Describe him.
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
This isn't homicide school.
You got any better ideas?
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Better than one.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Raw deal.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright?
Hey.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Answer the phone.
Well, that's great.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
See you later.  Good luck.
Keep them out of my way.
Dog food.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Where is escort service?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Okay.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
You said speak Czech!
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Don't want to film this?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Be quiet.  Watch.
Credit?
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
As a plumber?!
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
What are you coming here to do?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Oh yeah, why?
But you knew that, right?
How long they been livin' here?
Aren't you tired?
Not good.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
She's wonderful.
Right. Just a sec.
Sure, what is it?
It's possible.
What is it, Hal?
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Yes, Daddy.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Certainly.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Vodka.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Thank you.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Must be billy's girl.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Luther's on the move...
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Yeah, I read the report...
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I lost them, that's what happened.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
I didn't have the time.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What'd you do?
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Hi, it's me...
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Napoleon... small.
I brought the girl remember?
You noticed...
So you do know her.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
And then?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Yes. Of course..
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...Leeloo.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Yes ma..
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Have you pulled yourself together?
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Uh... not really.
Crystal.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Not without Leeloo.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Just one... why me?
Cornelius..
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
What is... Make Love?
All 900.
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Options.
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Sir!
Do you know how much I missed you?
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Honey, I'm not, please...
I understand.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Amy...
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
I'm camera shy.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Tell me what happened.
What did you do with her body?
Where?  Show me where.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Shut up.
Shut your mouth and drive!
I'm asking.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Fuck you.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Good for you.
Max.
There's not much illegal.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Sounds good, pops.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Where does he sell it?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I'm telling you it's not that.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm here.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
No.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
Yes.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
What?
Yes.
It's been six years.
Who are you?
Those are her belongings.
None too discreet, is he?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
What?
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
We have matching luggage.
That obvious, huh?
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Three days.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Then what else can we do?
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
She knew she was gonna die.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Don't worry, honey
It's okay, Dan
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
You're not taking my baby!
No...
She doesn't want me around
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
He's inside you, where he hides.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
No.  A deal's a deal.
I've got to go.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark!
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Faint.
He invited me to his house last night.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Huh?
I guess.
So?
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
'Us?'
You know - it <u>is</u>?
The sound again?
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Oh it does???
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Seems to be all around...
What???
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
There's got to be an explanation!
After torpedo room:  Report!
Minus three.
- for horrors like yourself?
I'll be another!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Toward the Pole!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
How soon?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
I hear Twombley got shot.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Yeah.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You played for the Sox?
What happened?
Yeah.
In the chest.
What?
I guess they're stupid.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Okay.
What are you sorry for?
I know.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Where's the plow?
Fuck you.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Yeah. A few things.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Could be.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
For a while.
Jack doesn't need money.
Good.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
When did she die?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Sleeping.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Everything you know is from me.
Twombley.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Money.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Well, I never heard that one.
For what?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I'm sure he's busy.
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
I'm sorry, honey.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Lemme take a look.
We don't know that.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
To swear you in as President.
Because it is my duty.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Ga get it.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
No.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Good. Good.
One thing I've learned as
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Gravity.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
That isn't necessary.
What?
Flying the plane.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
We're handling it, sir.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That's my job.
Yes, sir.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Dunn.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
If that's the way you want it.
What word would you use, Elaine?
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, please be careful.
That was very well put, Ted.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Compute!
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
No, I've been excited before.
Don't be too long.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Negative.
Go ahead.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Yes.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
No. I'm all alone.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Surely there must be something you can do.
I can't tell.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
That's right.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
I love you, Elaine.
Headquarters!? What is it?
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
What is it?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Randy.
Huh?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Would you go up, please?
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Here?
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
At the end of the bar.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
This is mole.  It's good.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
In the other man's rectum.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Nothing.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Ss'kya'ta'.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Departmental policy.
It is. 
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
She's right.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Dead on all channels.
I don't know.
They're but off!  Do something!
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
...We're coming in.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Are you finished?  You okay?
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
We didn't miss anything.
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Hudson, give us a break.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
What about me?
They're dead.
Where is she?
You mean dead.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
That's right.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Don't bother.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Yes!
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
What?
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Oh, damn!
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Oh, Stanzi.
I'm not telling you.
You'd think I was mad.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Yes.
Oh, thank you, sir!
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Not at all.
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Money! Money!
Oh, yes.
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Yes?
And the result satisfies.
Well. There it is.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
What? On one hearing only?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Am I not welcome?
It's a secret.
Mine?
Bene.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Animals?
German!
Wolfi!
Well, we can.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Of course not.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
What dead? Who is dead?
Who are you?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes!
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
What for?
On the contrary.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Mozart -
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
And do they believe it?
Do you believe it?
Did you try?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I poisoned his life.
What difference does that make?
Yes?
Never mind.
Incredible.
Yes, in the third act.
Well done, Sire!
Did we?
I can't wait.
I agree, Baron.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor?
Come to my office, Miss Price.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Is David acting strangely?
Yes, I should think so.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
I beg your pardon?
Yes?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
That's not really a very proper question.
Twenty-eight.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
A werewolf?
Of course.
I was awake and he was in my room.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Will you shut up!?!!
David, let's go now.
No.
No.
Why on earth do you say that?
You did, did you?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
Oh, come on, tell us.
That's very funny, that is.
Alex?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
She's a jerk.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Nice to see you.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
It's circling us.
Do you think it's a dog?
Not far enough. Come on.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Nurse!
I wanted to see you.
Yes.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
You don't have to say anything.
I want you to meet some people.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Yes - sureÂ
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Yeah.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yes, sir.
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
All right, Jack, all right.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Line?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Don't you know?
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
What are you doing here?
Now?
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Got a handkerchief?
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Hello, darling.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes?
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I haven't any.
Sure, I think it's swell.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
If he can do it, yes.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Don't you think I know it?
Is it safe?
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Are you sure?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Yes, sir.
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until afterÂ
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
I don't know.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
That was two hours ago.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Leave me alone, Bob.
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
Nope.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
What is wrong with you?
She got two of them.
Yeah.
So what do we do, General Lee?
I got three.
Yep.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Which one, right or left?
Me get heap firewater --
On account of we're robbing it.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
You're doing just fine.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
Got any ideas, little brother?
Yeah.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Sparkling rocks?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
You are a hell of a woman.
But I like the presidential suite.
Pity.
I'm not hanged yet.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I guess so.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
Move you fools!
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
THEN WHO DID?!
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
It is a nice piece of writing.
So you can't tell me anything?
I demand action.
In English, Pinkerton.
Can you put men at all four?
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Yes, dear.
Is it a what?
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip Â  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Yes, Courtney?
No-I can't take the time off work.
I don't want to talk about it.
Everybody's rich.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
I'm just leaving.
Good coloring.
There was no ad in the Times.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
What exactly do you mean?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
It's just not.
Lucky, I guess.
Uh huh.
Ask me a question.
Yes, sir.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Patrick?
Oh no. I have no plans.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
What are I doing?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
That's...that's too bad.
What?
No. I really don't.
Uh huh?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Shoot.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Not in the mood, I guess.
Marcus?
Where was Marcus?
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
"Make" him?
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Milo! What about --?
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Milo. Why would he --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
Guilt?
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I am. I am, sir.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Wanna be a part of history?
Is it your dish?
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
We tried!
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
I do!
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
I'm sure.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Talk about work? Never!
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
'Have a look?
'Sorry about the late notice...
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Wait... He knows.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Oh yeah?
Hmm?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Certainly not at my happy home.
What about "60 Minutes."
Before they kill somebody else, too.
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
What?
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
I met this girl.
She's a programmer?
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Where is he?
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Is it about my teeth?
Hey, how are you?
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Thank you, Exposition.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Hey, Mick!
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Sure.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Do you want to talk to him?
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
You know who.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Are you crazy?
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
What are you saying, son?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
My son?
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Yeah. What?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Blow me.
Show me.
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Great.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
Well, it's kind of weird.
No, he's really evil.
Seriously?
There are limits?
... bottle ...
... love ...
So I'm still ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
Promised? Who promised?
Sir August...?  What now?
I have an appointment.
We have met ...
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
So am I.
Next assignment?
Thank you, Steed.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Do you really think so?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
Is that written in his shoe?
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Nothing personal.
Always.  Except ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Not for a moment.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you didn't.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
No idea who. No idea why ...
It's called Black Leather.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Have a look at this.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Peter's brother?  But --
How did you guess?
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
I think so, thank you so much ...
She was ...
This way ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Perish the thought.
You are, and it's behind you.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
You're kidding.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Hey, man, congratulations!
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I want Debbie.
Yes I did.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Thank you, sir.
I've tried to change her mind.
I'm going now, Cole.
But a fabulous cook.
Are you going to have women at your party?
About what?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
A real turd.
Let's see your bread.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
What's going on?
Milt?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
It's Bullwinkle.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
All right, who serves?
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Rick!
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Of course.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
This isn't right.
The best table in the house.
About what?
My Debbie?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
No.  I need a drink.
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
Just come down, John. Just --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Not likely.
What, you've never seen one before?
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Roll the hose.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
Jennifer.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
When I was twenty.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
How's it going?
Well, you did invite me here.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Hey, do I know you?
Who's doing this?
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Pest control.
But the right guess on this is arson.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
How ya feeling?
Yeah.
No.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
No need to be modest, Brian.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
It's in my blood, Willy.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
I'm busy.
Fixing my roof.
He's out.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
You like everybody, Ronald.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
I might.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Who?
You mean you could use it.
I'm a Catholic.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Let me think about it.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
This psycho can.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
How 'bout...
B-L-A-K it is.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Who are you revolting against?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
What do I do?
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
And this is Manray.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
And I'm the feet.
I'm tired of waiting.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We was coming to see you.
EUREKA!!
Some tap dancing, some singing.
To what?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
Go on.  Good so far.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
It's me, Peerless.
Pleased to meet you.
How did you end up here?
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Always keep 'em laughing.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Do you know how you will use him?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
The pleasure is mine.
A gift.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
I thought it was appropiate.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That's why it will be so much fun.
He, I'm Mona.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Soon.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
You've never had any formal training, either?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
How be dat?
What do you want to know?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Are you trying to rap to me?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Only the agency of servants.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
That is a trifle strong.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
As much as possible.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
When is he to go?
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Yes, of course.
I see.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Yes?
Yes, papa.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
And he doesn't care about me?
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Can anybody hear me!
We found him like this --
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Shut up.  West's dead.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
I'm serious --
You saw West's body.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Epilepsy.
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Your weapons, Sergeant.
I...
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
You hated West more than any of us.
What don't you know?
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
Because I was standing next to him.
I didn't --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
And the problem is you only got three.
What the hell are you talking about --
What are you talking about?
I'm not even going to dignify that --
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Why?
Good cop/bad cop?
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Watch me.
What happened next?
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Good idea.
You mean the falsely accused?
Yeah.
Nah.
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
So you took off your shirt?
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
He whispered it in my ear.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Childs.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Then it's unofficial.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
We know.
Sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Thank you.
Edward Bloom.
It truly is.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Don.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
No.
Eighteen.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
I know.
Lucky girl.
I was dreaming.
No, I understand.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
I think someone hasn't.
Can we talk?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
Yes. Exactly.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
Really.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I'll help you.
I need to lie down for a bit.
You don't have to.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
You're not.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Really! That's wonderful.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Right.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Good. 
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
You're asking for my documents?
Uh. Do you like England?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry?
Happy bath day.
Yes I know.
I know you just want to punish me --
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Okay we won't talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Sometimes neither.
She's dead.
I'm trying to quit.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
What was her name?
Okay. Promise?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
It's not mine either.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Tell me about it.
Thanks.
Just wanted to see.
Yes?
You didn't have to do this.
You liked what I brung ya?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
I need ya help again.
Can I come in?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
No, ma'am.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
I got others.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Yeah.
And you gonna live it with him?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Let go of my arm...
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Why you got me chained?
What?
No ma'am.
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Or what?
Whose doin' is that?
Let go of me...
Uh-uh.
I don't fuckin' cook.
I can handle that.
Sure.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Naw!
I didn't start this, R.L.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Or what?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Yeah, I know.
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
The hell you call me?
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Get rid of it.
-- I should tear your head off.
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Connie...
High spirits, desire, commitment.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
You were too far behind.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
A resort city, Beppu.
What...?  Why?
Big enough.
Kampai.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
You could fake it.
Tell them I'm not.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Not in that company.
Yeah.
What...?  What if I say no?
You're foreigners.
Do you know what this is?
I have to get to Sugai.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
You certainly have a nice place here.
Not to be trapped.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Why?
Like what?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
She's not with you?
Your customer, eh?
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,

It's okay.  Forget it.
My pleasure.
Ya.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Prosit.
Sorry.
Huh huh.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Too old.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Why should I be?
I think you need more help than you've got.
Yeah.
Can you?  I couldn't.
Right.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
You did?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Like?
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Because it's not.
No, I don't.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
Five, maybe six.
I'm tired of this.
Don't move.
What one?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
We sure did.
I'm Adam Webber.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
You're lost?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Oh, that's nice.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
No.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
What's the pay?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
What for?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Two weeks.
Thank-Q!
Wow.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Well...yeah. Okay.
Good-bye!
And don't be so obvious!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I'm sorry.
Goodnight!
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
No. Sit down.
Blow out the candles!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Yes, father?! Yes?
I promise. Is that all?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Yes, sir. It's true.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
You nut!
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Juneau.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
True.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Yeah...Seems to.
Bye, Adam!
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
Then after that it's safe.
No.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
What?
Honey?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Would you excuse me?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Well, I am the head of this household--
Some time.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Oh, my God...
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
I think...it...works.
He's from Alaska.
Always good advice.
Eve?!
Those sluts!
To bed.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
He didn't leave with them.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Fallout shelter.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
You did? A human ear?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Okay.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Yes sir.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
I wanted to see you.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
Never before this.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I'll go then.
It's okay. It's okay.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Don? Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Please, please stay.
Frank is coming?
Frank would open you.
No, it's not Don.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I did. Are you?
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
My bourbon.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Here's to Ben.
What?
Nothing.
Yes.
Okay Frank.
Be right down.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
No. No thank you.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Why not?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
He got a little jealous.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Where to?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
I can't find the second one, sir.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Where's your gun?
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Yes.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
I-I'll tip her.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
For what?
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Yes.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Rule of thumb?
Can she I.D. them?
Rocco!
You... oh god, why?
It was... It was...
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What?
Sweet-n-low!
Shit! Shit!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey, Murph.
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
How long since your last confession, my son?
The... The funny man.
Right. The blond guy.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
No. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
That sets it off.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Don't even say it, man.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No. We didn't.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
On the left.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
I don't think we can do that.
You don't know how to hotwire.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
How much?
I know that. But --
Right now.
Get out of the way.
Eleven fifteen.
I did.
Yes. I do.
Roger.
Take your second position.
Good. It's supposed to be.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Careful. Check his pulse.
I'll get him.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Behind Bob's house.
What?
Nice to meet you.
Grammar.
So do I.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Take a deep breath.
That sounds like Dignan.
Me?
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
See you, Bob.
I hope not.
He looked too shaken-up.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Sixty days?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Jesus Christ! No.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Cuba.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
What do you mean?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
True.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Yes. I did.
It's true, Dignan.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
He electrocuted someone?
His name was Swifty?
That's too bad.
There were more than that.
He wouldn't move.
It's registered in my mother's name.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
I'm going back.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I didn't have any choice.
I think so.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
He said what?
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
26 weeks.
He's damn good.
Well, I think --
Got a little lucky.
Good to know you, John.
What do you mean?
Never heard of it.
I want to know about Treadstone.
...this is Conklin's computer.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Keep going...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
I speak English.
Yes...
You killed them.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know who that is.
I worry when you get like this.
-- where? -
What if it's not who you think it is?
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Tell me later.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Who is Pamela Landy?
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
What's that?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
And the Germans can't match it?
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
What? The tapes?
Is there. Is all there.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
If you say so.
You mean, did I want a date?
I don't want to leave.
It was in Latin, sir.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Hamish, I... thank...
Aye.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
Shall I leave, M'lord?
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Let her speak.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
You scare me.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
How do you know this?
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
What is it?
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Can't he come out for one day?
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Okay.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
What? What could he do?
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
You know my father?
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
But I... I need those books.
I thought you were a December baby.
Damn. Your dad did this?
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Hi, Lenny.
I've stopped a hundred times.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Of course.
It was a long time ago.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Evan Treborn.
Deal. Now read me something.
Gee, thanks friend.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
What's wrong with you?!
Huh?
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Oh my God oh my God...
You're such a retard!
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Yes, Monsieur.
No thanks, Carl.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I won't.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
It's not for sale at any price.
And the carrying charges?
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
No.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
You can believe that if you want to.
Please.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
When did you first find out he was alive?
And Laszlo?
No.
But what about us?
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Apparently he has the letters.
-- Yes?
I love you very much, my dear.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Thank you.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Yes.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Very well.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
I see what you mean.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Huh!
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
He'll take one.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Our expenses?
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Hello Ugarte.
-- You thought what?
I don't want them here overnight.
I like it fine here.
No.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
Worse than Warsaw.
Feels so good to lie here.
Fix raft first.
No!
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Well, not really, I --
I've got lots of time.
Let's take a look.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
You want to.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Yeah.
So did I.
Mom, meet Jango.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
I braided them.
Forty-three days.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
I know.
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
Two.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Burma!
Okay...
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Please don't...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I never said they were boring.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Someone not from Maine.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Actually, I volunteered.
Migrants?
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Right.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
Is it true?
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
In other words, scurvy.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
It's just my heart.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
We see you next harvest.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
She took off in the night!
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Tough day?
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
Know who I am, Jake?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Gee... What makes you say that?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
It's not true.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
We're going to give him the money back?
Let's go, Jake?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
You sure?
Eight A.M. flight.
I have a good crew.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
No thanks. I'm good.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Sure.
Help me.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Don't worry about it.
Then show me how.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
WHAT?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
No, I want my cut!
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Where the hell is she?
Jake? Customs?
I'm sorry.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
In over your head?
A little bit of both.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I can handle it.
It's not history.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Roger that.
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
That's what I'm talking about.
High five.
No. Thanks.
Why did you quit?
I can imagine.
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I want a job, Giles.
I'm working on that soccer story.
Not entirely.
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
Fine.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I'm on at nine.
Why not?
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Marion. It's a book.
It's the truth.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You were talking in your sleep.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
I want to buy a car.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
You know where I'm from?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
That's fine.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
What kind of trouble?
Who's they?
And I thought you were a bright woman.
You're serious.
What about my neck?
I can't do it, Jani.
I told you, all bets are off.
Yes.
Do you?
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Thanks.
Nice car.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Has he?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Give me 365.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
How?
Yes.
Fine.
I think he's talking to it.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Time to start talking.
-- open quantum latches --
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Energy shielding positive function.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Thanks.
Hey, bomb.
Of course.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Right!
Of course not.
Yes, well...
Doolittle...
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
What?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Yeah.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
That's a lotta crap.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
What?  Where're we going?
No time.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
It's a rule.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
When?
Girl's gotta make a living.
First time I ever heard that.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
It was open.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
That would be appropriate, yes.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
You don't want to.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
Here's your money.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They're prisoners to their genes.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
Max--
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
Lydia.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
I'll give it my best shot.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Say the words, "I understand."
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Gin.
Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
It's okay.
Believe it.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Bye.
What? That's disgusting!
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
Check!
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Tickets?
Oh, yeah...?
What's gone?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Check.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Go ahead, Jam.
Uhh... nothing.
I said, I'm sorry!
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
We won?!
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Neither do I!
GOOD MORNING!
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Donnie.
A metal craft of any kind.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
What did you say?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Wonder where we'll be then.
I'm sorry.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Yeah?
Why?
You want to kiss me...
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
But you're OK?
Where are we going?
Yeah...
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
When did you stop taking your medication?
That is a terrible nickname.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Grandma Death.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Why should we care?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
Frank.
How so?
I don't own a television.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
I know.
I... I was playing with fire.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Because you tell Mom everything.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Come again?
Frank?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
I guess they made him do it.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
No more fuckin' for her.
She's right over there.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Yah?
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
You heard me. Where is it?
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yes...
Yes, Leslie!
Shut it up, Loretta.
Anyone?
My dress'll reek.
Ohio...
What?
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Nothin' too showy!
We need more bars!
Enid ate a whole pan!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
And everything.  He should be king!
The President of the United States.
"My"...
"My dear"...
Take a letter...
I wanna powder my nose...
He only weighs ten ounces --
Did you shoot the rapids?
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
I can't do it right away.
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Bah!! 
That's it...
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Yes please, two.
How lovely.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Do you?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
No, more of an acquaintance.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
...Yes, Sir.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I could easily arrange...
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
What a mess.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Yes.
y-y-yes--
Oh no, my friend...
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Yyyess.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
How is your tea, John?
Good morning.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Yes, John?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Yes! The workhouse!
No, he's very upset about something.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
There IS no one.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
But, Father, it IS!
What are what?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I'll bring it back.
That's right!
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Yes -- I believe you do.
The second note to wake the Gods...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Well, how d'you think I feel?
You don't love ME.
What -- rape?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Very deep... usually...
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
I know!
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
That's my boy!
Sorry.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
The sun! That's it!
So?
No! Arrgh!
Who gets killed?
Just say something cheerful.
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But...
What is it?
I will join my grandfather there.
Please.
What do we have to do?
No, it is NOT.
No, I'm not.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Hang on...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
What have you got there?
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
How can we stops him now?
Help!
So did your father...
But it's a responsibility...
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Sh!
No... he's not... not... there...
Say hi to Naomi.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
You were not.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Yes?
Probably see you at the book store.
Yeah?
You know Wilmont?
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Very much.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Yeah.
No, not at all.
That's scary sounding.
Yes.
When?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Where are you going?
No, it isn't that.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
What?
Really? Is he cute?
I love it!
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Oh.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I love you.
Tomorrow?
Make love?
That's okay. I --
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
Hi.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
That's your look for me.
Well... I did.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Oh! Great. That's great!
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I know. Anyway --
'kay.
I better do this, Stan.
We haven't checked.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
How did I look?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Thanks, Stan.
Nothing.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
It was a mutual decision.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
She came to help, Howard.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Jesus.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Yeah.
Jesus, Patrick!
I know who you are.
Siwash, huh?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I don't.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
What is Debbie's position?
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Well.... er...
What guy?
I have to go, Julian.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Your ranch?
A job for me?
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
What?
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
It is not.
You're okay now, it's over...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Hurry.
We'll make it.
"Another man?" Who?
No.
Hear what?
What happened?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Starck!
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
There's no one here, Skipper.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
The date.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
I don't know...
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
You're lying...!
Starck... Cooper...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Something like that, yeah.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
I just finished drying...
What about the life readings you picked up?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Five seconds.
Yes.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
I did.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
1000 meters...
How?
Ship's log.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
It's easy for you to be patient.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
You'd never know it.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Got it, teach.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Go back to the drawing board.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
And they're changing into...
What do you mean "complete"?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
What about you?
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Right, whatever, have fun.
But all these people...
Johnny.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
It's been changed.
Great minds think alike.
We need to get past them.
What...?  Oh.
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
You need a doctor.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Susan. What are you doing?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
You want to work at Carl's?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
No. I want my money back right now.
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Where did you hear that?
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
They were left over from the last shift.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Mark is a really nice boy...
Well...
So are you.  Are you shaking?
What? Are you all right?
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Yes.
I've been swimming, Merv.
All right.
Should we buy a frame for that?
He was hot, wasn't he?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Climax together.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
No.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
What do you think it is?
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
Yeah, like maybe never.
Really?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
How about your phone number?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Do you want to come inside?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Do you really have to go?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
I'll get you the notes.
I'd like that.
Yes... It makes sense.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Righto!
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Crying? Why was she crying?
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Las Vegas.
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Damn right!
My heart!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Are you ready?
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
They were all veterans.
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Part of what?
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
With what just happened upstairs --
Gonna stay for a couple?
We're lucky to be alive.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
Just move!
We gotta try.
What?
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
Nothing.
Covered.
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Whoa!
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
F-f-fuck you.
Clear!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
If he doesn't shut up...
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Get something on that.
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
YOU'LL HIT US!
And the last one is the...
Wait God-dammit!
GO-GO-GO!!
Stop her!
Oh...
I'll do anything to help.
I'd love to.
I think --
Um, well...
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
I'm not!
I'm not!
Huh.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
An actress.
He knows, Frances.
Claire?
...Yes.
Showdown.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Really?
Is Kaminski a Communist?
He's a socialist, then?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
You really want to go?
And you think it's worth all this?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
What?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Forget it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
The hell you will, Harry York.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Frances...
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Huh?
What's that?
No. To thoroughbreds.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
Yeah. I don't know.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
'Golden Boy.'
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
I already have.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
You're taking me home!
Why are these all opened?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
What's wrong?
I'll be back.
Yes, Mama.
Oh bullshit.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
And what's that?
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Stay calm, please.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
You drove him to his torment.
What kindness?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Materials. Nothing more.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Her body pleases me.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
She's not for you.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I wish to be your husband.
So do I.
Open this door for no-one!
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
As a march hare.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Can you think of a better reason?
It's a letter to my father.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
I resent God's monopoly.
No. He had more important work.
You've been going round-the-clock?
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
I'm... dying.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Tomorrow is another day.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I finished the boats.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
You okay?
Artist.
I don't know.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
They're off now.
Okay.
Marcie?
I can't, Barry...
I had to.
That was the telephone.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Umhummmmph.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Those things can be nasty.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
I said new, this is an '90.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Yes, she is.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
No, I didn't.
Pass.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
In the Winnebago.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
No!
Sure.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Yes.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
-- you got your microwave --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
Knock yourself out.
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
He signaled the Ranger.
You believe me don't cha?
No.
No.
Yes.
What?
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
This ain't the time.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Where are you right now?
It don't look together.
He needs our help!
I've been accused of that wish.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
What'd you find, Kathy?
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Standing right here in my office.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Sir?  What did he say?
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Sir?
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Just like you would be.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Well, now I feel so much better.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
That's a good story.
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Sure, sure.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
I don't know...
You heard me.  Move on.
Educate her, Pyro.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
So am I.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Go in there. Talk to her.
Nearly four years...
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
I got pretty close.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Who is he?
What's it to you?
This is not the place...
It's your choice.
What?
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
I don't think so.
I'll try.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
It's Tatopoulos.
That's right.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
But you don't know for sure!
Are you sure? How do you know?
Sure.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
...Damn you!  Damn you!
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
"Just!?"
Nothing.
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Shut up.
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
We need another one.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
You... know us?
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Something BAD happened here.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Yeah, what is it?
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Let me think. I need time to think.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Gwen...
Mark 12.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Home.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
It doesn't have eyes.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
And a French alliance?
It is.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
Same old story.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
A lot of years have gone by.
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
We already have black soldiers in our army...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
They help me understand why we fight.
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
I... they look both the same.
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
Some things must never change.
Martha!  For God's sake!
We're leaving them?
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
That's a lie!
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
George, I'm sorry.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
It's stupid, of course.
I think I will disappoint you.
I see...
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
You're right.
So you didn't have the key with you.
So... how many movies you been in?
Your who?
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Tell you what...
Gimme an hour.
Bear, you're not really gonna Â-
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Never heard of him.
Ray. Look at me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
I'm in the movie business.
I'm a producer.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
What've you got?
Where you been, Harry?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
Harry, look at me.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
So what's the problem?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Hey, Harry.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
He died.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
Like this?
Compass.
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
You broke in?
That's right. Three percent.
How much is the wife offered?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
...That's what we finally decided.
"Cotton".
I just caught the end.
Sounds fair.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Depends, who pays?
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You thought I was faking?
Oh.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
I'm going into the movie business.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Harry -Â
That's where you got the idea?
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
What money?
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Thanks.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
I don't know. Tuesday?
What?
Roger?
Maybe he isn't alone.
Then what the hell happened to him?
How long to fix?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Like I always say --
Hard to say.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Three, four days.
She take a radio?
It looks like it.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
What is it?
I don't know what you're talking about?
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Don't lie to me!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
If money can buy what he wants.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
That's what I call a payday.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Nope.
So what did happen?
The guy. He just came this way.
There's somebody else on this boat.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Collision? With what?
If it was a ship she hit.
I don't know, are we?
Right here.
Maybe it was more than that.
Go.
Of course they did.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
You're up late.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
We could call for help.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Fifteen, at the most.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
YES.
Not the Maxine?
God, how horrifying.
I guess.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I just buzzed him in.
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Huh?
I didn't check my messages...
Help me what?
But I was only trying to be friendly...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Hi.
Can I come in?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
That's just the way I am!
You loser!
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I dunno...
We should follow him home.
Bingo!
Come on, it's too late now...
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
Somewhere downtown.
What are you talking about?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
I don't believe you.
Where?
No way... when?
Like what?
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Which one?
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
We were such desperate sluts back then.
So should I come over?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Nothing.
Shhh!
Tell me what?
That tape sucked, by the way!
Norman.
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Yeah, well...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
PLEASE? We have to!
Shh!
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Really?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
YAAA!
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
In whatever way you think I mean.
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I had to see you.
What about this?
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
But, I...
Yeah.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
I don't know... where is she, then?
Why? What did she tell you?
That slut!
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
How; we don't know where they are?
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Starling?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
What?
What did I do?
Have you ever failed?
Don't they have to be?...
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Do you ever see him?
I won't.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
We definitely had a moment or two.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I don't know what to do anymore.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
What are you doing up here?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
My pleasure.
Command me, lord.
Yes.
Did I forget something?
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
Hello, Venkman.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Do it!  Just do it!
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
I'm ready.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
No, I just thought --
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Hi, Louis.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
I am Zuul.
So what do you think it was?
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
What?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
That's it.  Get out.
All right.
Goodbye.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Talk to my accountant. 
We'll get back to you.
What is it?
Has this ever happened before?
Are you Peter Venkman?
You could say that.
Yes, it would.
The magic word is "please."
Why do you want to see it?
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
A square?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
What is it?
Does she want to be?
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
I blame myself.
God, it's ugly!
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
That appears to be the case.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Do you want posters, too?
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
Caesar?
They won't break this one.
Until your confirmation date.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Jerses -- tomorrow...
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
Why do you play at being drunk?
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Tomorrow?
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
I can see that...
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
No.
No -- why should I?
I just want to tell you something.
No.
Yes.
No.
You sure you really want to?
You do?
Because I want to know what's happening.
Oh my God --
You've got to tell me what she said.
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
But Elaine --
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I just don't think it would...
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
No.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Hello -- who is this?
Mr. McQuire.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
I want you out of here.
Will you bring it in to me?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
The Singleman party, sir?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Oh no.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Is what a girl?
What?
No. 
What for?
What do you drink?
What?
Pardon?
Like what?
Sit down.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
Benjamin?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Right.
Yes, I have --
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Where is it?
Of course.
Waiter!
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
What?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Wait a minute.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Calm down, Benjamin.
We don't.
No.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
I don't.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
But why shouldn't I?
Then let's hear them.
Yes.
Of course you did.
You wouldn't.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
But if it's sickening for you --
May I stay then?
Thank you.
Then give me your word you won't.
Where is Elaine?
I'll find her.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
But I don't want you to make up something.
No.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Ben -- how old are you now?
How long have we known each other now?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
I will.
No, it's not --
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes, I can.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
That what he says. Right?
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
Yes.
The pearls are in her room.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
You're a fool!
No -- why? -- should I?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Where downstairs?
Of course.
All right. We'll dance.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes --
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
And...?
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone.
Oh -- 
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
For Vienna?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
No?
Why do you think --
Not at all, sir. 
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Ready, Baron.
I thought she was splendid!
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Good heavens. What for?
Send his bags up to my room.
You are ill.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Everything?
No.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
I didn't like Preysing right off.
You don't understand that do you?
What?
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Movies?
That's from skiing.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Hello!
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
I understand perfectly.
Well, he's a gentleman!
You think so?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Shhh -- here he is now.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All you have to do is phone for it.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Then, it's all over?
We did not approach you.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Again?
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
And if you do it wrong?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Goody!
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Well, make it stop!
I know.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
So I heard.
Oh, sure. Fine.
Perk.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Fair enough.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
You don't have the stomach for it.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
I've really got to --
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
And Myra's stuff?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I don't see why not.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Are you sure?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
All? It ain't bad.
Every day in every way.
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
I'll sign that affidavit.
Oh, come on, Roy.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Where?
Upstate where?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
What?
For Christ's sake, why not?
) What?
Yes?
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
No question, huh?
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Care to join me?
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Sweet dreams, Blake.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
No shit.
And miss the big game?  No way.
You sure?
Betcha' didn't predict that.
Forget it.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Will, sit down...
Just get on the bus.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
That would work.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
What?
He's my brother.
Yeah.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
I did alright.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Why?  You interested?
You can't expect us to stay here --
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
It's a sign.  He's come home.
An old friend.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
It was you.
Jamie's baby ...
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
No one.
No!!!
It's a bitch.
You know what gets me?
How all the magazines show tits today.
You know what gets me?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Go home!
Go home.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How do you know that?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Really?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
What's this?
In what way, pray tell?
You did?
Maybe it's time you got out.
If what?
They were enemies.  We were at war.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Where's Mom?
Everybody says he was so brave.
They were in the same creative writing class.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Tell me that.
Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Can't it keep till morning?
Will you go to bed?
Make it fast.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Nothing.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
I'm talking to you gently now.
Heaven.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
Situation.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I did?
Ram it up your ass!
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
No.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
Yes.
Sneaking in the back door.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Just one favor.
Sounds quite beautiful.
I plan to live one hundred years!
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Ooops.
It's always locked.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I've never heard of it.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
What for?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
And terror, if you don't mind.
I'm high as a kite.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
My violin is avenged!
I'm utterly satisfied.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
No!
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
If you want to be found that way.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Jesus.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Premature ejaculation.
I don't want to live any more.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
I was afraid to ask.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
He can hardly talk.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
He isn't any friend of Father.
I know.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
Marry me instead.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
It is?
That's the XKE.
It's suicide!
Paul's only twelve years old.
It's a jungle out there.
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
I believe in miracles now.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
You mean I'm black?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
How many weeks?
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Okay.
What's that shade of blue called?
Yeah. How did you know?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Do you know where she would be?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
'Sucking off.'
You don't understand shit.
Tijuana.
He deals in pain.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
...What do you have to offer?
Yeah.
No.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Just leave me alone.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What?
Where!
Yeah.
Okay.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
What?
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
In other words, you want to get laid?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
What do you think of that? Or this?
I'm worried about Jake.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
You working in San Diego now?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
None of that, lady.
Is this your shovel?
Where are the papers?
Lady! Be quiet.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Your hearse?
Promise?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Certainly a new experience for me.
What do you mean?
Because they are all the same.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Over there by the courthouse.
Is he all right?
Well, I really don't drink...
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Well, I don't...
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yes.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
What was that?
I like you, Maude.
Where's that?
What is it, Harold?
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Yes. They're old friends.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But why now?
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
At a funeral.
I don't care what people say.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
A rough estimate.
Ah, yes.
I don't know.
I go to funerals.
No.  I'd have liked to.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
You think so, sir?
To pit your own life against another.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Another man's life in your sights.
ZAT!
Yes.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
We've always been here.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
I knew you'd come.
She certainly has.
It certainly is.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Are you crazy?
Finish what?
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
What is it?
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
I thought you liked being on TV.
Who wards off demons.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
Don't move. We --
My job.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Father's back?  Still angry?
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not from you.
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Goodnight.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Cocky.
Two steps back, please.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Sure.
It'll go in.
Her mother's dead.
Julia's my second wife.
You did this before, right?
To a man called Frank Cotton?
HE did. I've seen him.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
Kirsty?
This isn't happening.
One last time. Give me the box.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Ssh!
Hurting.
You're hurting.
Not know.
You promised me an explanation.
A box?
Hell...
Which is where?
Where's Daddy?
I have to see my father.
I was here this afternoon.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You mean we're moving in?
I hear you.
In here.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
Shit.
So damn stupid.
Are you O.K.?
I'm here.
O.K.
What's wrong with you?
You want something to drink?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Do you care ?
I won't be a moment.
Is Julia here?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
No. It's all over.
I AM house-trained.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
Sure. Why not?
'Bye.
I don't know.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Say it.
Well what's the point in that?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
Ehh.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Ha.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
What band?
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
So?  You even said they're good.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
You can be and are wrong.
We work there!
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Oh, hi.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
What's his name?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Can I help you?
Fine.
I understand, Dick.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
You look upset.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I should be so lucky.
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
And do you like it that way?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Will you please just go?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
I guess.
Nothing.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Mmm hmm.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Pig died.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
C'mon.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
What's the difference?
To make you feel better.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You're tougher.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
You called this morning?
How're you holding up?
Nor have you!
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
No, we...
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Thanks.
Why?
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
The boy _died_?
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Yes.
Probably.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Where?
That bothers you?
Yes.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
At least.
A factor of age.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
What about that family in '31?
You kill with your left hand?
Is that a threat?
All of it finished.
The inheritance.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
What's all of this got to do with me?
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
What are you doing man?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
No!
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Me arm hurts.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
I feel hardly nothing.
And you?
That is not me.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
It can be different.  It must be.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Thanks.
Where did you learn that?
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
You'd think he'd had practice.
And the Bulgarian?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
-Since you last saw me.
You're insane.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Leave her out of this.
Leave her alone.
That's none of your business.
Your murder weapon?
Where were you Tuesday night?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
His only kid.
No.
Hello, Bensinger.
No. Roy. Roy V.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Where are we going?
No -- she didn't.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
No, you don't!
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
No, I can't.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
Listen, Walter --
What's the matter?
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
What's his line?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
You're not afraid, are you?
No kidding?
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
I know. Where is he, I said.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
I get it!
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
All right, Walter.
Where's Bruce?
What tickets?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
What's that -- what's that?
You know you did!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
You got plenty of money?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
What?
They can't do that to me!
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Hold her, boys!
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Yeah. But I --
No, I couldn't do that.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Throw him out, Frank.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Editorials?
What did you do with her?
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
That's good.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Mother!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Keep away!
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
They're not human!
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Ssh!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Who do you think!
The what?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
You can't bribe me!
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I know.
But Grandpa, you said...
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Apparently so.
Who told you that?
They're not.
I don't mind.
Bugger off.
Could.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
...and four and five...
I'm starting my own collection.
They might be.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Kiss me Hardy.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Propaganda. We've been had.
Jam.
You taste it.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Fair enough.  The river.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Half the time he's bluffing.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Up to six weeks, I think.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Yikes.
Cool.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Baby! Stop!
No, I told you...
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Come on.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Yeah, come on.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
You're welcome.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Nice.
You know... a couple of queers.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
I don't know.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Yeah, showtime for what?
Lock the fucking doors.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
It won't work.
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
I hear ya.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
When?
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Shhhhhh.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Not yet.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Great.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
You said it, not me.
Huh?
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
Shhhh... you hear that?
I ain't got a warrant.
Yes, sir.
That's it?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
Right...  ...come on.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Like father, like son.
Woof.
Oui, doctor, oui.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Shh.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Unnhh.
Urgh.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That's Lila?
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Really?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Three foot one.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
And I think I'm going to.
Please, honey, let me in.
With pleasure.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
No biggie.
I'll be out in a minute.
Why certainly!
Of course.
What?
A deer?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
He looks perfectly fine.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
I'm just preoccupied.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
I guess.
Really?
That was wonderful!
Should I come with?
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Mm hmm.
It's open...  What'll you have?
No, I'm fine.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
Do we need words?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
How?
That's the way it's done.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Two.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
To do what?
Hi. How's business?
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Where do I sign?
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
Well, I win sometimes.
'Bout even.
I don't know.
How're the hands?
I said we're leavin'.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
You well-heeled, partner?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Give me a drink, will ya?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
A son.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Aw, Eddie.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
How much?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Would you like to come out tonight?
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Okay?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Half and a dollar.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Yes.
Since four.
Around.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
Give me a drag.
You told me.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
I'm getting treatments right here.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
Yes, I'm glad.
Why?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Yeah. That's right, too.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Thousand dollars a game.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
Yes.
You're not them.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
We don't know that --
Have you looked inside?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Stay alive.
Yes.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Round back.
That's the Air Force Base.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Was there anything over the hill?
I'll take you to school.
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
Why, yes.  Why?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
No.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
What?
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
What kind, Mom?
It's really nice of you to help us.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
Can you believe this?
What happened?
Three years.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
Moishe, please, don't talk.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
You as well.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
Better than we thought.
It had been deemed classified.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Yes, I am.
He's my angel.
No. Exotic.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
It's all fuzzy.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
We're leaving.
Above American soil?
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Here... now.
You are on your own?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Where?
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
I'm going after Dad.
What?
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
How dare he?!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
That was our assessment as well.
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Find something?
What?
Mine, too.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
So it did.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
All I have to do is scream.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Don't call me that, please.
Look, can we discuss this later?
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What?
What?
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
What?
Brody's this way.
All right Dad -- tell me.
What final challenge?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
Thanks.
Junior?! Dad...
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
My name is Kazim.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Finally!
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
I don't like to show off.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Yeah, that's what happened...
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Why they glow like that?
Two are still missing.
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Siam.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Their children?
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
THE WHAT?!
I know the feeling...
What does the writing say?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Willie!
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
You've got to go to sleep now.
And they don't even know what it really is.
Al ???!!!
Don't do that.
What is your name?
I just got here.
Where are we now?
Right.
Who am I?
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
That a new Datsun?
Me? What'd I do?
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
You're gonna explain.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Too late...They want you.
No. Don't tell the guards.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Take a left and your next right.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I can't remember..
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
I'm at the airport.
We get on a plane.
We'll change your appearance.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What is it?
Little late for that.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
The sand.
Why not?
Try another language.
...Rene...
What are you looking at?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Who, me?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
I don't know what's going on.
How do you know?
Is that all?
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
Don't worry!
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
You were with GRUNER!
No. You can't trust her.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
I've got an idea.
Well...?
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Now, you're too suspicious.
Yeah, sure.
You're lovely.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
Surveilliance on them all.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
He's not an ordinary man.
We insist.
And how do you service foreigners.
What?
Oh...that's okay.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Here?
I feel fine.
...I'm looking for someone.
Yes?
Where?
...right here too.
...Rene.
I just work for the travel firm.
Why?
Is that Ryuji?
How often they come here?
Wanted to get to know you.
What do you mean?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
No.
Food doesn't agree with me.
Get your things.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
We figure out if it's in here.
Get us one.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
I asked him.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Why not, what are you going to do?
You're gonna laugh.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Do something!
It was you.
That's twenty feet high.
I know a nice island.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Thanks.
Just one. The back up.
Tear it apart?
It'l be alright.
It doesn't hurt.
For reading.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Yes, baby?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Monday.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, I'm not...
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
No, no, we're fine...
How grave?
"Mike?"
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
How are you, Jim?
Okay.  Lowell?
Don't you have to be at the office?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
That's right...
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
What?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Yeah... Thank you.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Did work.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
You okay?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
They do this with impunity!
I'll call them, Lowell.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
Yeah, great.
I don't know what to do.
You mean... since this morning?
What?!
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What does this have to do with my testimony?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
She's okay.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Liane has filed for divorce...
You're gonna get your fix...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
It acts as a drug on the body?
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Chapter and verse.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
You did good, Massey!
After you, Doll.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I just want to make sure that you both --
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Who do you want me to kill?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Mr. Dumbarton.
No...
We rest, Your Honor.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
It's your move, Miles.
Yes?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
No.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Isn't everything?
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Did you see the tape?
But you don't agree?
You don't believe in it.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Marylin! Listen to me.
So I hear. Is that all?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
No. Don't stop.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
No.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want to sleep on it?
Yes. Again.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hello Marylin.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Marylin?
No buts. Now. Out.
Please! Leave the house.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Marylin?
You have some?
Sometimes I forget.
Jesus.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
So where are you now?
Hello Miles.
I want to be exposed.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Nothing.
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Mother?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Oh, no, sir. No different thanÂ
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here forÂ
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itÂif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  MmmÂmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, please, DadÂ
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this oneÂ
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsÂall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Yes, sir.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
What do they say?
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Maybe they doÂand maybe they don't.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything thatÂ
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
You must have me confused withÂ
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Beat it! 
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, butÂ you've been very kind. 
Oh, this?ÂI like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Smart aleck!
Not at all. 
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
I can't go out like this.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Um. You're doing all right.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
What's the matter?
I don't trust that chatterbox.
Why, haven't youÂ?
I'm following you.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" rideÂ
What?
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Oh, PeterÂ 
knowÂbutÂ
wasÂbutÂ
No. But I've got a penknife. 
I hate the horrid stuff.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Amazing.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What for?
Why not? I'm hungry.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Yeah, swell.
Me?
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
I'm out! I'm out!
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Do you know?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Huh?
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeÂunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
Yeah. Come onÂcome on!
YeahÂwouldn't it?
Huh?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeÂandÂ
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up withÂ
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Oh, gee, MisterÂyou wouldn'tÂyou ain't thinkin' aboutÂ
SureÂsureÂI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
No.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
I did.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
Dave?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
I had the cause of death.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
What?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
A Willie O'Keefe?
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Nonsense.  What next?
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Huh?
Well... yeah.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
What are you driving at, boss?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
How many men?
No.
They're gonna love you, chief.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Yes.
Was he there often?
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Germany.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Yes.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Not a problem.
Oh, that's not a problem.
Who was there for your ass?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
In his inside coat pocket.
I found out.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
She wants to make a deal.
She almost sounds scared.
She wants to go back to work.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
I'm not saying another word.
That's my diet shit.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
In cash.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Was she helpful?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I am. Have a seat.
Sure.
It looks nice.
The Delfonics.
Are you?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
Right around here, in the food court.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
The day you got me out of jail?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
That's my job.
What if I've figured a way?
Do you think they bought it?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
It's not that simple.
Tell him you want to see him?
Why?
What do you tell Nicolet?
I'm sure.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
You'll get over that.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
What the fuck is that shit?
If I'm working, I can help you.
He sells guns.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Was she there?
I never have. It's not my money.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
So what happens now?
Great...  ...Wanda!
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Dreaming.
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Hi, Melanie.
Sure.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
That's a good idea.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Managers get ten percent.
I'll give ya ten.
What'd you care?
I need to talk to you alone.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Man, I don't like that part.
She don't know shit about the money.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
Designer clothes.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Susanville.
What's a Metrix?
No.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You been to Japan?
Who's arm is that?
Must of made quite an impression.
That sounds like a problem.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Does that bother you?
You live with him.
Uh-huh?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
This one.
Okay, Lou-is.
Are you serious?
That's good money.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Which one is for the car?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Twice. In the parking lot.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
It's in there.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
You gonna tell me who it was?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
He's a big one. You two tight?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Livingston, huh?
You don't say.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
House.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Hear what?
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Is that what I think it is?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
She got off, huh?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And where's Jackie?
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
I know where it is.
Uh-huh.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
No problem.
He leave town?
Then what are you doing here?
No, thanks.
Like Della.
Stop!!!!
What do you want from me?
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Tell your mother.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Used you?
How long had that been going on?
... I've seen them, too.
Her knee acting up?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I know.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
What? By myself?
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
Save me!
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Look at her face. A real bitch.
What's wrong?
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
They weren't human!
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
The numbers stop at 107.
Get your clothes off.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Lie down!
Am I home?
I love you, Jez.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
Why didn't you call me?
I don't believe this.
Let go!
Stay away from me, Jez.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I'm not upset.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Mid-town mostly.
Sit down, Jake.
You know who I am.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
I don't know.
One drop?
Just relax.
No. I couldn't.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Help me!
I'm awake?
What's wrong?
Why not?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
You come home with me.
Died?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
We don't have a choice!
We made it?
Done?
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
He came for me, I had to run!
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
The hull's imploding!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Then stop talking and work faster!
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
What?
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
What if we don't?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Oh sure, all the time.
Okay, good tip.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
She broke my fucking nose!
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
NO!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Would you?
You're leaving me here alone?
Crutch?
Maybe she tripped.
Oh shit! There he is!
Ow!
Who are you apologizing to?
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Obviously so.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
You're crazy!
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Sure, Dad.
What do you mean 'We...?'
Who's driving the boat?
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
Where...?
Have you ever had one do this?
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
I never hear the whistle.
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
What'll I tell the kids?
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
No, we just checked the beach...
Let's all have a drink.
You could say that.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Chum?
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
They must've hit something.
Be careful, for chrissake.
I didn't know her.
Some friends and me took a house.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Twenty years.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Anti-Shark cage.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
I'm okay...
What do you see?
I think I can top that, Mister...
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Um, hi?
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
No...
Yeah. That was me.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Okay.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
I'm a junior.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
I wrote that.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
You're kidding!
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
That suits you.
Why? What the big deal?
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Is Vanessa here?
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
I actually know this one.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Sure.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Room with a toilet, got it.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Nothing...
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
I am a suicide risk.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
I'm pregnant.
Share the love, Tits!
Right, seriously.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
He whips you?
Sure.
Jeez... Adele!
...That's not true.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Early, you are so sweet.
As many times as it takes.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Best kind.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
...Ha.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Why?
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
What are you going to do?
No, never. Excuse me.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
What is it?
Who are you?
Where would we find him?
Without his car?
...That'd be my guess.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
What for? That guys a dick.
Yep.
Unzip my pack, yo.
Yeah.
Yeah me too nigga.
Yeah. She's only 13.
Yeah.
Bet.
Why I do what?
What are you talking about?
Good luck?
Hold up man.
Yeah.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Yeah. Do it again.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
At the block party?
You were?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
She won't? Why not?
Tonight?
Yes.
Nothing?
No, Fidget, I...
Yeah.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
No.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Thanks.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
Passion...
Yeah?
Yep.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Making love is like.
Yeah.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
It's very monotonous.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
OK.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
What do you want?
I was at the beach.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Sit down!
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Local?
Anything?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
But a hundred men could move him.
He was with me?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Where is she?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
You're not going to tell me that.
Not really.
Because she's the type.
You like to brag, don't you?
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
No!  Wait!!
Thanks.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
That's great.
And this Jeremy--
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
That's a big area to cover.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
Through a rental agency.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I got it from the tournament directory.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
I went out.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Yes.
When I was very young.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
Another kind of game?
Of course.
You're not?
No.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I'm sorry.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
You've got to face the things you feel.
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
I thought you said the line was busy?
Can I come in?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
You don't understand.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Are you going to come tonight?
I got lucky.
That's worse.
<u>What</u>?
About what?
Colwyn.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
I don't know how.
All directions are the same here.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Yes.
I won't leave you here.
I have no extraordinary powers.
What do you see?
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
I'm not sure.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Yes.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Where the spiral begins.
Use your sword.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
I ache with it.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
He saved our lives.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
To the place where Death lives.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I'd wish for a puppy.
Would you desert your friends?
We have plenty of hares.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Then look!
Then he will die!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is important to assure the succession.
That I am, my lady.
A match for your son, I think.
How many did you lose?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
Why must you know?
No.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Yeah.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Well, I don't need them...
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
Yes, yes...
You were scared, weren't you?
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
No, you can't go out.
Why?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
A little...
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
I love you so much, Leon.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Yeah, what?
Fine...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Huh? That's smart!
Huh?
...And how much is it?
Where?
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
I'll make it.
What?
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
I'll kill you!
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
Pardon?
You have?
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
Show me.
Where?
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Making the grand total?
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
So I've been informed.
Steph.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
What?  Who are you?
Evening News?
It's yours.
What are my choices?
No alcohol?
Water?
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
No -- S.E.R.A.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
OK.
When?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Yeah... I'd like that.
Let's stay for a while.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
I have a 4.0.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
You're fired. I have new representation.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
That's not what's important.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
See?
Spill.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
What's the point?  Look at me.
I'm so happy for you!
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Yes, you are.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
So?
Your scrunchie?
What?!
No way --
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
For a butt-head? Yes.
What?!
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Where's Warner?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Of course, I do!
Your what?
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
No, silly. I go here.
Harvard. Law school.
Uh -- sure.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Cunnilingus?
Yeah, luckily.
Then we smash 'em?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
Do it now!
What will become of me then?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
And, now?
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Who might these friends be?
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
No... but what choice have we?
The chill is worse this night.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
It doesn't matter.
The wound is mortal.
I don't... understand.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Sunlight, you say?
Did you bring me here to sup?
Never show mercy!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
I'll try.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
I may have said perhaps...
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
Be patient.
Shhh!
To fetch your napkin.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Only what's right...
You've freed me, Jack...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
You're teasing still.
Pinching me!
Everywhere!  Ow!
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
And am I not fair?
You... you... you mortal you!
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
And as barren of love as stone.
Be fair, Oona.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Oh, but I have.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
To Castle Couer de Noir?
You've been inside?
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
You'd better call and cancel.
Has he eaten anything at all?
No.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
What are you doing here?
You look better without make-up.
Why?
No thanks.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
I'm not gay.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
What?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Floating to Catalina.
He's got a standing invitation.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
We've known each other since grade school.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
A sink?
If that's what it takes.
It's thirty feet.
What are you on?
How's your wife?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
For everything.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
Yes, it is.
She's out with a friend.
Uh huh.
Not a shower.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
You'll have money when you work for it.
Hey...hey!
Oh, okay.
The gloves on the table are for you.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
I know.  Why?
What do you know about me?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Good for you.
I'd build a house.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Left you this place.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
She's a little sad, is all.
Where is he?
What did you do with your dog?
Why would they tow your truck?
Why call me?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Where will you live?
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Well, for later then.
What have you been before today?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
My stupid back.
I smiled at him.
That was the truth.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Does Alyssa know?
His father is a man.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
What?
I know.
I never asked for more.
This is what he wants.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
I just thought it would be nice.
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
Dad's home, already?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
That's because I've never been here before.
Good old Monroe.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Nothing.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
A loan officer?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Yeah, I want some pie.
So you made a generous contribution.
It ain't here.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Forget it.
What do you want, Claude?
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I said you're soft.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Don't touch that car.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Made just for you, Cookie.
No problem. Oh, boy!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Satchmo.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
What do you think about... Earth?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
All right. Let me out.
Don't do it!
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
An angel?
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Release the evil?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Definitely.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
So go get 'em, Dad!
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
You got it.
It's Stanley, sir.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
That way.
You keep a bat under your seat?
You smell like coconuts.
Really?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
School?
Are you dead?
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
I don't know?
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
Anything to eat?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Your own work?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
I'm Mary 2.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
All right.
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
Muscle? I don't know that one.
He's good, isn't he?
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
No.
All this. All of it.
I don't know... but it does.
What's that?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Alive?
More... many more.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Yes...
Oh my... I'll try.
Too little.
I don't think so.
Yeah.
This is our bedroom.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
What is?
As best we can.
Or something.
Or not so recently?
Yeah.
Yeah... Laurent.
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Over there.
Me, too.
We should stop seeing each other.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Alice, I...
Yes, I believe so.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Sure.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Sit down.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
What's the word on the street?
Nothin'.
Who was the man?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No, nothing.
Maybe.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Whatiya mean?
I don't want to talk about it...
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I do like you, Sheila.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
I'm a paleontologist.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Why, of course. Yes.
Yes!
Will you stop squawking!
Please don't call me Lovey.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
In a quandary.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Over by that hill.
Well - I'mÂ
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing businessÂ
How do you do?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
You have no disputes over women?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Shall we have another?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Splendid!
Thank you.
Pardon meÂ
How can we get in touch with them?
Father Perrault is dead.
What is it, my son?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Do you think this will come in my time?
Come on! Quick! This way.
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Dead?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
You can't leave, George.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
She's going with me.
You're wrong, George.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes.
What was that?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
What if he refuses?
Where are we going? Huh?
We'd be eternally grateful if youÂ
My name's Sondra.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Bump?
You see, it's not a dream.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Why?
Why?
I was just going to.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
Yes.  Barney!
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Kay, I'm sorry...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
What?  Who the hell are you?
What?
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
It was a long time ago.-
Why?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
What if he's telling the truth?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
I'd double it and add 20.
Do his job.
In case I need it.
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Do have any idea what I just said?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I dunno. One?
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Yeah, Kay?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
They're not my pals--
I wanna make a deal.
This guy.  Where was he?
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
They went right to the President.
Did it leave?
Oh shit!
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
They're inside.
He'll turn around.
What is it?
Anderton --
She's still alive?
Oh, Jesus...
Then who was he?
Anne Lively...
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
It's all I could safely move.
They were performance pieces.
The nano... what?
Drowning.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Uh-huh...
What?
I'm fine.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
I show a cop on horseback.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Yeah?  So?
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Just a nickname.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
I need help with her.
They don't belong to anybody.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
Hold your breath, Dad...
He's alive?
The precogs were wrong.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
You're not gonna kill me...
I'm... not... a... killer.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Hold that thought.
The safest place of all.
If... you have one.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
He's dead, Lara.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Tell him not now.
Not.  Now.
My God...
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
He's my subordinate!
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Yes, I know.
There's thousands of units like this one.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
How many?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
Who?
I know who you are.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You mean after he lost your son.
But John was with him at the pool?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
What's 'incidentals?'
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
We're in Fashion.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
How could you let her see this?
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
You driving her?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
Ruiz tied in out there?
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Ricky's taken care of.
Where's Ricky.
This one?
They were out of line --
No.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Yeah.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Traveling light. I like that.
Soho.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Well, this is the corner.
Understand me?
What are you saying?
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Nah, don't bother --
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
What's up?
We don't need guns.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
No more, man.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Well, come on then. It's back here.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
I didn't do anything --
The line's over there.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
You see a Ricky Slade?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Cool. See you later.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Watch it...
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Word.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
Tell me.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
He had it coming.
Solid, daddy.
Nnnnnnn!
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Now.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
What do you do with your time?
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
-- the hardest and the greatest.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
If you want to tell me.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
Why do you ask?
You're with me even when you're away.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
What do you want me to do?
You have to sleep for three.
I'm tired of praying.
Let's get out of this cold.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
Allah Akbar.
Say what you're saying.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
500.
No. You'll be marked for death.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Fine as May wine.
The hell you are.
I ain't doing bad.
Tell him about Baldy.
What can you do?
Might be all right.
Watch your tongue, boy.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
So you are going to talk me to death.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[I believe you.]
[Who's he?]
[Don't lie to me!]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
I said the plan was right here.
Pinta...
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
I'm a bargain.
Time will tell.
That's right.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
It's better to be free, right?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
I know you're not.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Still not a question.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Then don't come.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Do you know what she told me last night?
For a year?
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
Hmm?
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
What was she to Creasy then?
Which one was that?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
It must be one o'clock.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Where you going?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Well, it ain't your baby.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
I know it pains.
Were the lights on?
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Yes, I know.
I don't.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Oh, I'm fine.
Please...
I'll wait for your call.
Sure.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
No, I'm not kidding.
I'll see you around.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, what?
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
You gonna get married.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
Hey, Ang'...
You want a beer, Ang'?
Hiya, Ralph...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Well...
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
I don't wanna talk about it!
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Just one for a start.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Pour one for Painless.
Look at that right eye.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
What the hell's going on here?
Same general idea.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
When?
Be right with you.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
You betcher ass, General.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I like an olive.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
I don't get it.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
It's possible
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Same here.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
Thanks.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Just in dreams?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Morning, Captain.
What's that, Henry?
Good morning.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Hello.
Yeah, that's the one.
Look, JohnÂwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just aÂ
Yes, I did, John. But IÂI had no idea what was going on.
And, Miss MitchellÂI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
A third party?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
You bet I will, Ma.
What letter?
There is no letter.
There is no letter. I made it up.
In what man!
So?
Oh.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomÂunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
That'sÂ
No.
Where is she?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
The heelots!
I know why you're hangin' aroundÂyou're stuck on a girlÂthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man DelaneyÂ
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Yeah, you bet!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
How?
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearÂand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
No.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that peopleÂ
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Uh-huh.
Well, you know how they are in baseballÂif a guy's mixed up in a racketÂ
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveÂflopped into a chairÂand has taken out his ocarina.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
You're my hero.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Is there a problem?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...a car.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Being faxed over now.
Spread it out.
Yeah.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
Why? You like my ass?
You living together?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Every couple of months, huh?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
No.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Okay, stop.
I do.
To run late!
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
What do you want from me?
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
It's very nice.
Scottie...
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Hmm?
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
What?
Depends. What's up?
I'll provide you with transportation.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
True.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Guests?
Wake up?!
In a computer program.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
-- He will.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
What?
Her?
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Yes.
I know.
There?
Resurrection.
-- Waiter.
Speed?
How can we reach Phaedos?
Ah... sure.
Stylin'!
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
... Let's take a look over there.
What does that mean?!
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
TRICERATOPS!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
A stellar idea, Skull.
There's enough for everybody!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
Look closer.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
So they've been destroyed?
How'd you know?
What's going on?!
LET'S DO IT!?
You've got the public upset, Al.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But I've never served a day.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Charlie Luciano.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Not another word.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
No. Not everything.
But if ya can't catch the guys...
Who hired the bastard?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
For being a bootlegger?
It's a mask.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
It always is.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
Who?
They don't give a shit about us!
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
I got partners.
I found that out.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
You disrespect our tradition.
Okay. I'm listening.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Shuddup.
Spare us.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Fuck 'em.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Switch hands.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Sad commentary, huh?
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
A piĹata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Who?
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
All right. You can come.
I don't <u>know</u>.
What?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
We like to think so, yeah.
What pictures?
Mother!
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
And where is she?
So, you come here all by yourself?
... Oh ...
This way?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
I did not--
Never.
Looks like it, but--
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
And to Don Quixote!
"There's more light here," he says--
My friends?
Waiter!
I apologize.
Tunnel?
We're gonna get married.
No--not offhand--
Right now--everything I own--!
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Oh--Jim!
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
What stuff?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
For a question!
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Will he yield for a question?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
What?
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
We'd better see.
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
J-Jefferson Smith.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
How?
Why?
*This* is.
We're over in the House.
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Why?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
It *is* not!
No!
No!
No! Stop it!
In Terry Canyon?
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Wait--
Hurray!
Wonderful!
Splendid.
"So help me God."
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
What do you mean? What's going on?
A Bill! Not *him*!
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Just a minute, Joe!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Page boys!
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Oh yes, pixilated.
He sure is.
No.
Your Honor!
NO!!
What's that got to do with it?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Really?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What did they say?
It's wonderful.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
Oh, thatÂ
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
I don't blame you.
No, I don't mind.
Yes, of course.
Nothing.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Have lunch.
Had the boys follow us.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
JohnÂ
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to getÂ
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Perfect! Perfect!
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-NÂ
Okay.
How do you do.
Buffer?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Uh-huh.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Entertainment?
What're you talking about?
Arthur wants to quit!
Oh, they insisted on following me.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Shut up!
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Well, thanks, I - uhÂ  How do you do? What is your name?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Huh?
Oh. That.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Well, I play the tuba.
Yes?
I write poetry.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Binge?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
What two policemen?
Who?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Ernest, what do you think?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Yes, your honor.
I'm sorry, your honor.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Yeah.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
It's a pretty piece of land.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
-- Go on!
Sure I can, Lionel.
I'm trying.
We're going for a walk.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Mother... go away!
Why don't you tell me?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Could I see Sofie, please?
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
What?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Yes.
Disgusting.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
You're upset.
I don't follow you.
Okay...
What?
It's a big part of the show.
It's my bit for the community.
Uh-huh.
Really?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
Don't you like this?
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Jerking off?
It's not?
Holy shit!
You were messed up, man.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Things got a lot worse.
That'd be Lily.
All new people start with that...
See you Thursday... regular time.
Wow.
When?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Sounds familiar.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Intestines.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
Proceed!
Twenty.
No.
I just decked your brother
The things that get you excited.
Who was talking about what?
Because that's my name.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Yes?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
That just makes you more gullible.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Um, well, you see...
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
I know you knew I'd know.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Really?
And some sandwiches --
I'm the Bowler.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
What did he mean?
Doctor Heller?
Thanks.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
And the nuts always call themselves great.
You're dead.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Sure -- I guess.
You're a spy.
I saw him walk you home.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Not tonight. 
It is?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Yes.
LOOK!
But there's still only six of us.
With what?
But look at him... and look at us.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
So you're chicken?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Come on.
Yes.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Oh hi, Mom.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
I always knew that you were special.
Whatever our name is.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
No, thank you.
Are you serious?
You could have them here by daybreak.
I'm not insulted.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Come in.
A glass of champagne, please.
Oh -- where do you come from?
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
I see...
Four o'clock.
The first reports came in at about ten.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
What is that?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Would you like some brandy?
I'll have the fire built up.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, I am, sir.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
One had better legs.
I don't understand you.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
What are you talking about?
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
There are some things... better left unsaid.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
About Hippolyte Charles.
Yes?
Yes.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Of course, my dear.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Anything you need.
Thanks, Unc.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Don't move me.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
I'll do it.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
That's the sister.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
Okay, plan B.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I don't.
I don't know yet.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
No.
What about me?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't know.
I said hold on!
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
I'll remember.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
Negative...they vamped.
Where's Craig?
Why did he go in the house?
20 minutes?
I got fired too.
I don't know.
Nothing.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't know, Debo.
What?
Good, let's get out.
I don't know.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Elroy.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
That's my girl.
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
Sorry.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
What?
It was because I had this...in my pocket
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Good.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Let me talk to her again.
I think you're right.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
Oh, man...
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
What are you supposed to do?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
I've done much better ones than this.
A surprise?
Where?
Go ahead, sugar Die.
Do it!
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
When'll the skiff be ready?
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
How do you mean?
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Mister Powell!
What!
There! What's so hard about that!
Why?
That's Daddy!
Dead.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Is that all?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
What?
Yonder.
Yes?
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Pearl and John.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
She turned me out of the bed.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
I'm through, Harry.
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Them kids!
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Slept like a rock.
No.
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
No.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
You do?
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
What?
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Krueger.
Okay.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Nancy!
S'curity.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Nobody's gonna kill you.
You were screaming like crazy.
He's nuts about you.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Jungle man fix Jane.
Have you any money?
An omelet.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
I have nothing to hide.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
And there?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
Right now it's on the balcony.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
You didn't get legal advice?
With two f's, if you please.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
We have opened a restaurant...
The Duchess...
Good morning, Gaston.
Go to bed.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Yes.
Count d'Algout...
It is Thursday!
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
No, no.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
Yes, Comrade.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
You're going to force us... huh?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
No.
You're welcome.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I'll try.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
The bayonet? Did you really?
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
You know I want to...
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
Then how did you get here?
Then you should go back to your table.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
I don't think so.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
All right, we'll make it red.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
Who cried that one?
They belong to the people.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
No.
You can't imagine.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Am I interrupting?
Months, Swana.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
Has done what?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
We have nothing to discuss.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Go on.
Why?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
This will do. 
Can you recommend a restaurant?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
You did say it, sir.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
You do it.
How so?
Yeah?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Mitchell?
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
I thought the gloves were off.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
That's what they're doing.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Yes, you approved it, sir.
"National Priority."
All right.
How is this national security?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
You never told him?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
What about the documents he promised?
No ...
Why me?
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
I know ...
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Agreed.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
What do you mean, Jack?
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
There's no other choice.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Looks can be deceiving ...
I was the lesser of two evils.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
... but it was all we had.
Mr. Nixon.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
You're shittin' me.
Syracuse.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Elvis I like, too.
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Yes, yes.
I know ...
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
Not that.  Us.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
And then you'll be happy?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
Thank you.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Uh-huh.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Well. If you say so.
Okay.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
...I need to sit down.
No. But I gave my word.
To your husband.
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Goin' out.
You should be used to that.
Yes ma'am?
Where does he work?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
You know she won't be there.
I was just passin' the time.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Everything.
Sir?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Okay.
Yessir. I understand that.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
The what?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I do like you.
Sugar?
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
I'm a welder.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
To kill your wife.
I don't know. American citizens.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
What about it?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
Oh. How come?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
I am?
Umm, I don't think that...
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
I'd rather not...
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Oh, Betty --
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Yeah, me too.
Are you and Larry happy?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
You knew Del?!
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Didn't I?
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
What's so special about it?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Make sure it's elevated...
Roy! What are you doing here?
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
What's his real name?
I'll go to the Hospital.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
God, that's awful!
Fine.
He is real.
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
...among others.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
A doctor on the show... why?
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Very graceful. Perfect form.
What do you mean?
Oh, five years, give or take.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
No! Let me try this!
Uh-huh.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
"A Reason to Love."
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Fire! I hate fire!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Not that I'm aware.
Okay, Everett.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Helluva awgazation.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
You -
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Well sure, honey, but...
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Don't I know it.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
You didn't know that at the time!
That don't make no sense!
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Great.
What for?
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
I joined the Navy.
Nobody. It just came to me.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Yes, Joe.
No, sir!
Not exactly, sir.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Yes, sir!
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Yes, sir!
Pardon?
No, sir.
Zack, don't!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
What's stopping you?
Does it still hurt?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I bet you do!
That's brilliant.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
It's mine.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
She didn't.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
I have the gun.
I can't just...
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She better.
You finish.  Then we finish.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Shit!
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Open it.
I said open the door.
No fucking way.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
That room!
It doesn't work?!
What do they want?
What am I, a five year old?
I'm here.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Shhh...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Uh uh.
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tell you...
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Yeah, it's me.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Look this is bull...
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
We're like policing the police.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
I'm down.
They were empty...
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
And who is we?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
If you got something to say, say it.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
I don't know. I really don't.
Late summer.
Thank you.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
That would be nice, too.
As do you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Oh?
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Very well, proceed, sir.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Yes.
Not yet.  What happened?
You know how old I am.
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
You know what happened.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
And what do they know?
Go on.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
I stand corrected.
Balderdash!
Name five hundred.
That's five, keep going...
Thank you.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
Long time.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Bite?
Yaay!
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Allman Brothers.
Sure.
Yes.
I don't know.
Then come on.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Why? For God's sake, why?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Wendigo?
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's forgotten.
You're doing fine.
Louis, are you sure?
Elizabeth goes free!
He didn't waste it.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
Wait as long as you like.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Will -- you can't trust him.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I can't breathe.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Yes -- yes.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
More to drink!
Nor did you, I noticed.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
What?  He never told me that.
How did he get off the island?
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
Somewhat.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Agreed!
We need to go!
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
My father.  William Turner?
This way!
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
My apologies, Governor.
Speak.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
No, thank you.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You're not rotting meat.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Why are there two ottomans?
The nanobot is gone.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Shut up and do it!
You better quit pushing me, pal.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
A man?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Who isn't?
The big house?
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
That's what I thought.
Yeah, we'll see.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
Daniel, what are you doing here?
The nanobot.
Mouse?  What mouse?
What happened to it?
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
That was 'simple'?
Got it.
The waste.
Three days ago it was.
No, why?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Yeah.  Old times.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
I don't know.
What did you want my hair for?
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
The same thing I suppose.
I remember I was trying to help...
Oh yes you are!
That's right.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Oh yeah?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Yes - Sing Sing.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
No? Why not?
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
No - give you another guess.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear gartersÂ
What are you talking about?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Stewart!
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this eveningÂ
Oh, man!
I'm afraid.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Yeah?
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
I'm not quitting!
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Dawson, sir.
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Well!
I didn't run away.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Staring at us?
Hello, Stew.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Been where?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Conrad.
Right.
Sorry, bossÂ
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Surely, come right in.
Sure.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
WhyÂ
With pleasure, Madame!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Now the lady said you may goÂ
Yes, sir.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
A bird in a gilded cage?
Yeah?
Sure.
What?
We're in Pleasantville?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I think it looks nice.
She's crying.
I don't know.
Oh, gosh no.
... Lover's Lane.
It is?
So.
It's better, Mary Sue.
She won't go out with me?
No it couldn't!
I'm fine--but thank you.
Thank you very much.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Yes I did.
Yes I do.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
The basketball team?
You're not allowed to lie.
Why am I out of order?
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Green.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
I don't know.
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
He won't notice anyway.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Nothing.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
That's great.
Wow.
Yes.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Oh ... Hi.
Yeah.
We'll just put up the top.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Right. And how did she dress him?
... Hi.
Why?
No you're not.
I'm going to leave now.
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
What?
... Yeah.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yeah ...
Just listen to me ...
Forget about that!
Why?
No, that's not it.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Yeah but what are you doing?
No, no, no.
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
Why?
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
That's your fault not mine.
Did I say that?
I'm sorry.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
I'm in my bedroom.
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
You have a girlfriend?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I have to go.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
I don't know.
Thank you.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
Yeah.
....Hi.....
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Yeah.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Nothing.
Ok.
Did something happen; are you alright?
What?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
If you come to Hawaii --
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
yeah.
Yeah......yeah.....
Yeah.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Yeah.
I'm fine are you ok?
What is this?
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
For what?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Just have you for one second, please.
Did you do it?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
How?
Why? ...what?
That's fine.
Hello, how are you?
Yes it is.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
Barry Egan.
What's that for?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
Like a psychiatrist?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Yes I'm fine.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Yeah.
What?
How much money do you have in your pockets?
You have another house somewhere or something?
Are you serious with this?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't be late.
You can't be late though.
You can't just stay in your house.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
When can you leave?
Ok.
Sorry.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
He did seem a little strange.
Should I call you later?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
He's a writer, not a madman.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
At your service, Count.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
Yes, Abbe?
What? What've I done?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
That's enough.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
Your wig. Remove your wig.
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
Of course.
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
And my own.
Enough!
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Quite.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur DelbenÄ; I look to the future.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
There's something else I want from you.
What's that then?
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
No. But tell him I would.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
....shame on you, truly...
You've come to lecture me?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Very much.
Am I?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
I can't
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
So I've been told.
Do you?
Why is that, Louis?
Yeah
There's no call for that language-
How much?
How much?
Yes.
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
I am not that woman.
There's nothing to explain
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
How so?
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
No -- no -- I mean--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Showing life
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
We're doing Hearst.
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
She was . . . innocent
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .

But it's not a great syllable
Uh huh.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
So they're Jews. . .
What does this have to do with--?
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Yes.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.

Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
Ah, it's a grand title.
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Then find another theater
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
No, we're jake. But listen-
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
For what?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
And where you goin'?
Hit me in the face.
Here's your glove.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
What do you mean?
Yeah, I know.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
When?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
What?
It feels real good.
Can you see it?
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Now take your panties off.
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
No, I'm not.
Yeah.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Positive.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I went to the movies.
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
What're you talking about?
With Salvy, eh?
What?
OK. Talk.
Why don't you just call him?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Don't make no difference no more.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Namely?
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
You think I made all this up?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Give him evidence.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Ever get an answer?
You figured that out, huh?
All the things I hate.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Gunnison?
It's me.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Well, I only quote from the best.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
She expects me to marry her.
I don't want to.
I'm not ready for marriage.
She's just not the girl for me.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
You called the police?
You can tell that from here?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
How much do you think you'll need?
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Only because it's expected of her.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Tired?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
I think it's enchanting.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Without any future?
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Now, Lisa --
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
Not yet!
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Thank you.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Too close.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Somebody find him a knife.
Stay there.
Okay.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Smashed the front door.
Down in back.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You still want to go home, Moose?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Yeah!
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Sorry.
He's just loaded, honey.
Look--just relax, will you?
I still think you should go down.
Stay here.  That was my son!
Do you hear from him, son?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Hi there.
What?
They're still there!
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Who's that!
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Man, you're schizoid!
Who?
I've got a gun.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
Pretty mixed up?
Chicken?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Oh.
I'm not so bad.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
I'm never going back.
I bet you hear everything I say!
Hi.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Hi.
He hates me.
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
You said you'd call my father.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
I didn't want to stop.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
He'll be dead when he does.
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Yes it was all you --
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Beauty and fragrances.
We could live it up and --
I'll see what I can do.
Your brother...
What's going ON!!!
You're in on this.
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
What?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
What college.
Her brother.
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Get out.
I'm gonna need some money.
Don't tip.
Nnn... nothing...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
I don't know... what you're...
I don't steal any --
Where is he?! Where is he?!
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
My what?!
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
Not with you.
How do we take them out?
Haven't thought about it.
What?
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Thought you hate your old man.
What, working security?
Alamo...
YOU TELL HER!
How'd you know I'd do it.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Well...sorry...
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Elois?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
It's a change.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Who gives a damn?
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
No, they're not.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Don't ask me that.
Mr. Pink.
Nope.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
It's a surprise.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Joe.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Why not?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
Where? Are they out in the car?
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
That fuckin did it!
What are you gonna do about him?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
I suppose it is.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Thanks.
Will she be dark or fair?
You're not going out to look for them?
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
All right -- it's said!
It's going to Sonora.
Maybe they will.
Why?
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
And meet him there.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
I won't again.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
I don't care what she asked you.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
All right, you didn't know.
I said I didn't care.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Then why stay in the hills.
Well, say it.
I don't like to see you go.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Yeah, we sure have.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
And you've got me all figured out?
But you're his brother.
Do I know you?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Okay.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Open chest!!!
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
No. Keep rubbing.
I don't care. You pick.
So, whatever happened to her?
But he'll kill her!
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Just wait, you'll see.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Uh, uh.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Who?
In about fifteen minutes.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Hi.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
You do.
And sexy.
That's right.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
It says, "Ray."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
You said you hated him.
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
But, Chip...
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
We can be real quiet...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
No, I don't.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Marvin A. Pickles.
It's sugarless.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
Right here!
Bon Appetit!
He's a good boy.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Yes you are.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
You think my sister is there?
Yes.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
As a man, you distrust me Â- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
She can only use cash.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
"The Dante?"
I'll try there.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
I guess most people are.
But you do believe me?
A job?
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
We've tried so long to find her.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
But you're always at the library.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything ÂÂ and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
But why come to me?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
Unless what?
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
I'm very, very serious.
No, she's with her sister,
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Of course.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
We haven't even begun tea yet.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Nine years.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Kids? What about them?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Videotapes.
Who's Donna?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
I'm sorry this came up.
I know.
Yes.
Don't you want to make one?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Why?
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
You said you weren't always impotent.
What was the problem?
So you lied to her?
And now you can?
I'm not planning on it.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Not entirely.
Yes.
Possibly.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
You did that?
Are you having an affair?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Is that supposed to comfort me?
But I'm not.
Why don't I believe you?
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Radon leakage?
No, I haven't.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Why?
He doesn't have a phone.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Let me talk to him first.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, why?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what, then?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
I can't believe you did that!!
Hold on.
Bye.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
So will you, someday.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Nope.
Nope.
Not exactly.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
Yes.
No.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Is that what he tells you?
Okay.
No? Not even one more?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
So make an exception.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Cynthia. John.
I want to see you.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
It'll just be me.
What do you mean?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
So is my wife, asshole!!
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yes?
Yeah.
Was he nice to you?
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
Just breathe normally.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Who was she?
Lemme clarify for you.
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
NIGHT NIGHT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
I got it!  I got it!!!
He needs help.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Everything's free there.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
...closed?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Sure thing.
Who?
What show?
Why?
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
No...couldn't I do this later?
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Do you really think so?
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
What does he know about it?
YOU'RE NO GOOD
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
And?
So I guess that's it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Not so bad yourself.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
No, I'm an actor.
Well, in that case...
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
And Lexapro, yes.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
I owe her a call anyway.
Now we're talking.
When do we get to drink it?
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
She is very hot.
And she likes Pinot.
She works for tips!
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
I'm a quick learner.
What?
We were supposed to play golf.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Can you give me some room here?
You're an asshole.
Could be anything.
Obsessively.
You have to tell me --
No.
I know what you need.
What's up?
Huh. Let me think.
What's that?
The plan is... you go.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Hold on.
Hrnrnrn?
No, I'm okay.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
The Windmill.
See you.
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Yeah. Definitely.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Thanks.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Like what a fraud he was.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Goodnight, Miles.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
So what's happening with your book?
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
About a year.
I told you I need a drink.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
It tastes funny.
I heard them Morgan.
Who said I was going to die?
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Are you going to do this or what?
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
I got him.
Ray Reddy's house.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Got it!
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Yes.
I have some upstairs.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
What's two?
Don't yell at her!
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Don't call me Father.
The footprints.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
No.
Yeah.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
What friend is that?
Your next water ain't for three days.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Is he alive?
This is a brutal land.
That I do.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
My name is Emmett.
Not for five years.
I expect.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
What now?
He'll be here.
He is now.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
Let's get out of here.
I'm done talking. Get out.
We'd rather stay.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
Rae, I need help.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
You don't know?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Stella.
So-called?
Why'd you go into business with him?
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Spare me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
"Forever".
She'll drive herself.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Even the fall from the plane.
You really think so?
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Thank you.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
Impossible.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Hello, is this Elaine?
It was a great show, Dad...
Because obviously she existed, right?
Well, I --
Why?
Of course.
Please put your clothes on
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Hello, Hal.
You never were together, Hal.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Why not?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
I've seen them all before.
I don't know anything about computers.
You do?
I'm already dead.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Why?
I read.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Night, Lainey.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
What?!
This is the story.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Abduction?
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Is that why she left you?
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Thanks.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
If it's okay with you?
How do you draw now?
You mean aneurysm.
Look over there.
I don't tell her a thing.
Upset words.
Dr. Crowe.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Never mind.
Yes.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Yes, it did.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
What?
Oh.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Standing next to my window.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
S-ssstop that!
How'd he know I'd come?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Tramp.
Bitch.
...Hi.
Not lately.
No shit.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
"-- an AXE!"
He's right. Nice guitar break.
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
People say he was a murderer.
-- It's not me!
Amends...?
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
What's wrong?
You got something against farm people, Keith?
He's right. You were behind.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Let it go.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Why bother?
Bill, we need to talk!
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Just checking out the lights.
Hey, Grant.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Sorry.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
How many you need?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Okay.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Your what?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
And?
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
That man is your father?!?
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Six. Got it.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
They're jammed!
What's your twenty?
Not for long, you ain't.
What does the old Timex say?
Yeah, guy?
I ran into complications.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Now what?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
I'll believe it when I see it.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
Where the hell are you?
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Yeah.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
Ww... uh...
And threw us into the lake.
Mmm-hmm.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
You woulda?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
I'm not doing cocaine.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
I said I got his machine.
Look at the collar on that coat...
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I thought Heller was a double op?
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
What are you doing here?
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
I don't see it like that at all.
-- okay, g'head --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
A million flat.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
What?
What's the time frame?
Leave the light off.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Not her.  It.
Yes.
Oh, that's a relief.
How much sleep?
I don't know.
What is it?
Not necessarily.
No.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Just get him to stop.
Book?
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Rheya.  Not here.
Let's go home.
What do you mean?
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Rheya.
Do you?
I'm disgusting.
You should have told me.
When?
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
I'm not Snow.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
Hard to find doors in this place.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Queens... You know Queens?
Beg pardon?
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Urdu and Hindi.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Could be, I guess.
Tell it like it is.
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I know.
... Don't explain.
Yeah...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Absolutely.
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
Why?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
She bought it.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
Me neither.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Yeah, I think so.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
NoÂnot really.
Remember Little League?
Oh, sure.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
HarryÂ
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Hmf-hrr?
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just call me Spidey.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He knew.
Thank God.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
I'd never admit that.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm here...
Why?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
I know him.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Precise equipmentÂ such as waldosÂ
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
What?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
I'm not so happy myself.
No, no!  Not there!
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
That'll do.
In this barracks?
Who is it?
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
That's right.
And maybe a little something else?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Okay, Security -- what happened?
You are talking crazy!
Not you.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Say, Schulz --
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Let me go!
No?
Where'd that come from?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
It's not good for you, Animal.
It's that song, Harry!
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Are we boring you?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
Here. Take them.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
Just don't drool on it.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Thanks for pointing that out.
Twelve years, sir.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Can you project its course?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
You're in the Nexus.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Why would you want to leave?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
That's right.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
I thought you might.
I always do.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Make it so.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
What did you see, Chekov?
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
David!... What went wrong?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Underground deposit?
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Logic indicates that is the case.
Not exactly.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'll go...
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Aye, sir!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Goodbye, David.
What? What are you saying?
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Go, Sulu!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Any time.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
... Yes...
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
How is that...?
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
And who am I hiding from?
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
It's like the Garden of Eden...
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I have my orders.
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Is that a poem?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
I see. Helmsman?
How soon --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Is that what you came here to say?
The Admiral's son.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Visual --
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Chekov, who is this man?
Listen to me -- you men and women --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
I'm going down to the station.
Try the emergency channels...
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Not at present.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
How far?
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
It's all we've got.
Or the one.
Yes, sir.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Because... there was no way to win.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
You earned it.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
There is no such regulation.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Trying, sir!
Battle stations.
Aft thrusters, sir.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Aye, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
... They do, indeed.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
What do you think, Spock?
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
... Best shot...?
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
No, <u>my</u> name.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
I suppose they told you that...?
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
All right. The truth?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Kirk. They're gone.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
What are the variables...?
Exaggerate.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
I will, Admiral.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Picture, Uhura!
Yes, sir.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Mr. Sulu?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
What's the rush?
This way!
You're what?
I understand.
Sometimes I do.
For what purpose?
Androids... don't have...fun.
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
And our people?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Do you know how they were damaged?
Fail-safe?
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
You got me, Commander.
Eject the core.
How long 'til they reach us?
Remind me to lodge a protest...
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Bag him.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
I believe so.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Ready quantum torpedo.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
How serious is the damage?
Altitude fifty kilometers...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Great name. French?
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes, he is.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
'Fraid not.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
No. It's a lot further than that.
No... I'm from France.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Steady as she goes.
Aye, sir.
Yes, sir.
What?
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Agreed. Options?
Right.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Riker here.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
The charge is murder.
That's the question -
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Still think we're finished?
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Barely.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
I checked the data banks, yes.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Yes...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Except us.
Energize...
Aye, sir.
WHO ELSE...?
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Uhura, signal our surrender.
You hear that?
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
When does this conference start?
I was asked by my father to open neg-
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
... is to trust him.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Not as yet, sir.
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
I don't want to.
We've been ordered to -
What?
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Visual!
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
I believe I am.
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
For how long?
It'll serve you right.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
To happy endings.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
I can see that.
Aye, sir... This way.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Of you?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
An individual more like you, you mean.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Do you have a moment, sir?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
He wants to look me in the eye.
Ready, sir!
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Not with the Romulans.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
WonÂt do what, Mister Worf?
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Aye, sir.
Still well on our side...
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Yes.
You know I do.
How did you end up on Remus?
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Yes.
New worlds.
There is that.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
We are.
Why are you here?
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
On my way.
It is... invigorating.
She is here.
They're holding position.
For the moment.
I don't see anything.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
I understand.
Thank you.
He's got a gun!!
Stay right there...
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
It's in a green Mustang?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
No, we don't.
This is George Fox...
Don't... don't do this... please...
What.
Dashboard.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
You'll see.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
I am Jenny Haydn.
I know.
My... husband.
You. Mouth closed.
You want to try it?
It was yellow.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
I do not understand.
I need you.
Why?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I do not speak English.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes.
Yes?
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I don't understand 'friend.'
I understand.
He will.
I am your friend.
No. Get in.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I must meet my ship.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Horses.
Do they talk?!
I know how to gamble now.
I understand.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Sure.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Very beautiful country up here...
Was there visual contact?
I don't understand.
Just not the eyes.
Yeah, right.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
But this is a bad one.
Why me?
W'sup, Max?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Who was just here?
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Coming with you.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
She's my destiny.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
You sure?
I'm not going.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
That's right, Jan.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
What?
She's buried.
Winona.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
You know, you ever think about other women?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
Not bad, huh?
What do you want from me?
He had an orange hat on.
At the field office.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Just an observer.
What?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
This better be important.
Go ahead.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I didn't use Low's name.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
That information's being withheld from the media.
The man knew how to dress.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
What's this country coming to?
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
What did you tell him?
You did.
That's true.
What's that?
Suspect Zero.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
How are we going to find him?
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
I already have an employer.
It was the mall.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[What does the file say?]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
The same.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Murman!
I don't know about that.
Shuddup.
You're a comedian?
What's that like?
You better pay the man.
It does.
What what? What advantages?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
...and even then...
What else is going on?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
I'm a "Dorothy".
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Why not?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...get the hell outta here already...
...Six months.
Yeah?
Why didn't you call?
Right.
Right.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
No problem.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
Oh no?
I do. Good for you, man.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
Classy.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Ah, there's the rub...
I just tested for one...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
It's unbelievable.
No. Just O.J.
She wasn't your type anyway.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
I didn't make it...
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
So, what? Eleven?
...He's derivative...
Damned if I know...
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
I don't know...
I don't know...
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
You're crazy.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
We're gonna get laid, baby.
You think they're watching?
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Thanks for clarifying that.
Let's just leave.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Yes!
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
What?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
It starts at eight...
Yeah. You met him once.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
A day.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
...It's on.
You think?
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it's on.
Be smart about it.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
America has been good to me...
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
I'll come to you when I need you.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
I'm not hungry yet.
Understood.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Are you worried about security for your million?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Sure.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
No.
You wanted me to be your son.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
No.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
And when they shot me father...
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
Can you do it Mike?
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Did he give you his politicians?
Michael...
How do you do.
Sure.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
No.
I love you.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
When will I see you again?
Goodbye.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
How's Mom?
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Until the old man tells me different.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Maybe.
Yes, I promise.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
I don't get it.
Okay, darling.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Okay.
No, still here.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Your parents met her.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
What are you doing?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
Have you done something to your hair?
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Bird. That's jazz.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
To the manner born.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
Do you know Tom?
I hope so.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Okay then, you're crazy.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
A ragione. A ragione. 
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Thanks.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
I'm fine.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancĂŠe?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Huh?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
My name is Travis.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
It keeps ya busy.
What?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Keep it.
Yeah.
Kidding around... you know, fun.
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Have you been noticing anything strange?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
This is gotta be a game, right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
What is it? I'm busy.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
No.
You said that?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
In the jungle. 122nd.
You looking for some action?
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
He shoots dope too.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Why, thank you Travis.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
I know. I tried that.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Physical? Criminal?
Age?
You moonlightin?
Why do you ask?
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Why?
Shit.
Yeah?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Things got ya down?
The taxi life, you mean.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
It's about time.
Hi.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
I wish you were coming with me.
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
I had it, a minute ago...
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
Why me?
What?
Oh.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Thanks.
Guess I must've learned.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Yes.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
I do.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
When did I leave?
Ah.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
The film broke...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Vultures...
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Pete...
I guess I did.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
I... no, I... I just can't...
She's very pretty.
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
I... I don't believe this.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
I taught you that.
Oh.
Oh...
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
The war...
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
No. Just a few hours.
Yes.
Yes?
I despise it.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Then go.
Just listen to them!
They're birds!
Your brother told me.
Oh, I suppose so.
I know.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
Is she all right?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
The little Brenner girl.
Yep.
Yes?
Yes?
That's where the Brenners live.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Mmmm.
D'you want me to order one for you?
The little Brenner girl?
Impossible.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
They're back!
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
I'm simply quoting the law.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Yes, Mother.
I know, Mother.
I don't know.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Oh, thank you.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Not by the thousands.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Monday?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
The sign says strawberry finches.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Ahhh, but I know you.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Why?
Helping travelers.
What'll it say?
Yes.
Are you staying?
It's an uprising.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
After the gulls attacked.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
The bay doesn't.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
No... wait.  Hold me.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
And he'll talk?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Do you have any lovebirds?
What were the crows after at the school?
With smoke.
Not if they're starting a war.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Of course.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
But can't you give me any idea?
Good morning.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
MacFarlane
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
No.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Why, yes.
I wanted to see the white horse --
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
I am the best man for the job.
I've had some experience.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I take no gifts from you.
We have never been friends.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Burke them?
I come from Lisbon.
Three years.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
Aye --
I'm looking for my friends.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I think we should get some support?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Where the fuck did you come from?
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I know her friends.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
Yes I do, I really do.
It's what Lauren would do.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
I want you... to bend over.
Watch out!
No.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
That was my first question.
Yes -- that is true.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
Yes -- of course.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
All right.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
About five months -- your months.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
You still haven't answered my question.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Jittery is the word.
May I see you for a minute?
Yes--?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
What time is it?
Who?
Where is the meeting going to be?
Remember those words.
I -- I thought you were--
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
I'd give you a very good price.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
You better get some fresh air.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
We don't ride with vampires.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
El Vampiro.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
Maximum body-count.
Why?  They're only noodles.
For a ride.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
I will, David!
I can't do that!
Chill out Edgar.
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I told Max eight o'clock.
This is Michael.
Who, Laddie?
For what.
Oh, no, you won't.
Okay.
Smells like something died.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
But, Mom...
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Lucy.
Do I look that needy?
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Me, too.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Okay.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Save Laddie first.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Don't bother.
Don't turn on the light.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
The Marines.
Just listen.
Yeah.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
Watch Clark.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Ain't it there?
Let go of me...
If it did get to him.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
The dogs?
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
I think so.
Thank you.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
When was the last time you used it?
How far's that?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
You reach anybody yet?
Well, stick to it.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Little over two hours.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Move it, Palmer.
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
The generator!
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
And everyone looks like us?
What happened?
But there's nothing here.
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Can you show us where they live?
I'm used to that.
Yes... Thank you.
End...?
How do you control the Morlocks?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
What's happening to the moon?!
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
I mean... well... affection.
You know I can't.
No... let's walk through the city.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
I have something for you...
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Tonight's the night?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
For God's Sake, David --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I live with it every minute of every day.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
What is it?
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Good night.
We share everything.
Or mud carriers.
Did you have fires at night?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
So you can use it now?
Mara...?
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Imagine that.
Do they?
What are your people called?
Why?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Dean Fulton...
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
They're inside --
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
That's too bad.
My business?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You sure you know where to find one?
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
[Beat] What?
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
Yeah.
After I...
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
You think Lorenson kills you?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
[Beat] I don't know.
Believe me, I know.
Why would we do that?
You have no idea what's going on.
Maybe.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
What are you talking about?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Don't you go to jail for that?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
Is it true?
Sure.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
So you never knew your mother?
I'm sorry.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
You girls are in some hot water.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Tell us about him.
Oh, great.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
What for?
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Shut up.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Who is it?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
What did Darryl say?
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
I won't wait up.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Taking a shower.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Why not?!
Yeah.
You mean now or before?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Thelma!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
About how fast was I going?
Yes.
Just asking.
What do you mean?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Good.
It'd have to be pretty good.
You're drivin'.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
Oh.
Why?
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Say you're sorry.
Grrrreat!
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
What?
I'll try to be more careful.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
I guess.
He implied it.
Yeah, but he was successful.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Yeah, right.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Hm?
Jesus Christ you're right.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Call you back.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Healy, what I just tell you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Ahh.
Nepal? Have you been?
You own a home there?
That sounds like fun.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
You're a movie buff?
What?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Who the hell's Woogie?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
You don't buy what?
No.
Three different guys?
She's in a wheelchair?!
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Same here.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
I never said that.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
No I'm not.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
You mean he's not a criminal?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Just a minute.
You betcha!
Who's that?
He's dead.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Trying to be.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Toy poodle!
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
You forgot your keys!
Really?
Oh God.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
What if I can't?
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Smoke.
I think it's a bad idea.
Yes it is.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Yeah.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
That may be what they want us to think.
Jesus Christ...
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Hey. Nice tie.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Again. Figures, man.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
Goodbye.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
Who the fuck is he?
Good.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Let the press through.
After we've completed our investigation.
Bullshit.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
What do you mean?
So they took care of Leo.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
We're in there. We're in there --
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
Go ahead, Ray.
Mister Tully.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
How the hell do you know?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
I'm with someone.
Yeow!
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where were you?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Too aggressive?
I'm special.
What are you talking about?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
I'm starting to sense that now.
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
It's not suffering anymore.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
Where?
Why?
I'm still second best.
I'm fine.
It does.
I like to play "reality".
What truth?
Who's gonna win?
Well what?
Yes sir.
Yes sir!
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
He better be kidding!
What?  What is it?
BREAKING LEFT!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
You go. I'm staying with it.
Just relax.
But I have to!
Who's your pilot?
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
What?
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Come on. I died enough for one night.
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
SHIT!!
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
We did it.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Bad?
The wings..
I lost.
I know. I was there.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
You think I should quit?!
I know.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Over there man.
The Last Resort.
And you get a kickback.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Who are you?
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
It's about goddamn time.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Nice to meet you.
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Eight years.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You tell me.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
C'mon!
Oh, Rekall.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Let me buy you a drink.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
All right, forget about it.
I'm late.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
What's he talking about?
There's something I have to tell you...
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
The one in the mine!
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Ready as we'll ever be.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
I think I scared it!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Do not talk to the driver.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
That's the plan.
Adios, bridge!
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Val!  Val!
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Me, too.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
We got a plan!
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
You bet.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
You okay?
Let's assume that it is.
Please... I need to sleep...
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
Sustained.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
We had a description of the suspect.
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
-- Remember?
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
That's why I hate experts.
-- Roger -- ?
...For ten years, now.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
"No," what?
It's okay, Eddie.
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
No, s-sir.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Calls for speculation.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
-- alleged crime --
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
-- Eddie told you?
-- What trial?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
That's right.
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
What was?
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Bobby...
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Yep, it sure is.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
No, sir, we did not.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Any friends?
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's what I heard.
I think that's a good idea.
She's wearing a ring.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Faulty wiring.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
No.
I can't help you there.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Cause I like it.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Who would do that?
What does Bob say?
No... No...
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I already made you two tapes.
Let's go all the way.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
James...
Everything, but everything.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
What?
Sex?
Trees?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Mom, take it easy.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Dad...
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
Yes.
Yes.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Oh, Leland.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
That's right.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
Yes.
Nothing.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
How did you settle on the amount?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I...
I thought I would need it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
I know of him.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Yes!
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
It was good of you to meet...
...I made a reservation at...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
You live in the neighborhood?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
The TV didn't work.
Yes. It was, actually.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
What...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
If I don't 'grow up...'
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
Let me talk to Mickey.
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes. Price...
Missus...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Yeah.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I think we tried that. The case is over.
We got to talk.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
We, we were rather busy...
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
Yes.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
Come on out!  We're friends!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
What's he like?
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Would you like some coffee, General?
Don't you live at home?
I liked him.
It was...  ...one of them!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
So is the town, I notice!
It's always been a good persuader.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
Welcome to California!
Sort of a trial balloon.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Like what?
Heather, has there been another call?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Absolutely.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
Finish, please!
They were safe and could sleep.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Your bed?
Home, that's right.
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Listen, dammit.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Not yet.
Yep.
Your father?
He knows.
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Fifteen.
Yes sir.
Okay.
You're not a moron.
Believe what?
Congratulations.
Figured what out?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Me too.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
My dad.
Yes sir.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Sir...?
And, of course, we are.
It has nothing to do with him.
You do?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Why would you do that?
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
You know what he is talking about here?
What is it... the secret?
What's that?
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
About anything.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Sir.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
What?
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Artie? That you, Artie?
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
What's that?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Sailor... Lula loves you.
How's that?
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
That bastard Pucinski...
And?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
What happened to him?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
So?
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Got anyplace special in mind?
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
If you say so.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
One bad car accident...
You think she's gonna make it?
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
I'll bet.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Got any plans?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Well?...
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
I thought you were tinkering.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
She left me. Crabs.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Tripp.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Where would we go?
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Find the jacket.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
...we find the jacket.
Call it a hunch.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Do you know he won't expel him?
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
It's mine.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Shoot.
No. Sara, you don't understand...
It's very convincing.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
It's colder in there.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
I had to. Didn't I?
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
What's he saying?
I put you on the floor.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
But James. I mean... How long?
I don't know...  Me.
Hm.
Maybe...
Jesus, James. Wow.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Amazing.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Kinship.
How can you tell?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Because of my coat?
I never said that.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
In a minute. Get us a table.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
Chancellor.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
Simple.
Hm.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Really, Sara, I...
About the baby.
James Leer.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Would Walter really press charges?
I think I might have.
I said it didn't sound like you.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
And you're old.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
It's Grady, Walter.
I'm in love with your wife.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
I don't know. It might be...
Sick.
Taking the long way home.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
That's weird.
No, I'm going ho --
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Beautiful. How's business?
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
What?
When can I see her?
Is it because of Anna?
It's a nice table.
It was a beautiful present.
It wasn't like that.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
Next week? The week after?
I mean... feelings.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Why not?
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
It's a bright sound.
Do you come here often?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
No.
Little Red Riding Hood.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Yes.
It gives me headaches.
No you're not.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Your daddy will always love you.
Can't I stay a little longer?
What?
Ev-i-dence.
Reflect.
It's okay.
Forget it.
We have a few more minutes.
We have a lot of work to do.
What is your idea of being normal?
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
Not so fast.
In my bedroom, sleeping.
All right.
This is garbage!
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
I was six years old!
Time.
I feel... okay.
K through sixth.
You must hate it.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
Maybe later.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Hi.
I molested little girls.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
How many girls did you molest?
Twelve years in prison?
Hey, I'm not --
Why young girls, Walter?
I was always the one seduced.
Not ever?
What?
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
Where're you?
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
No way that could just be seawater.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Hey, you okay?
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Now what?
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Let's go, guys.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Missed what?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Check this out.
She'll wait.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
But you just said that a month was too...
What! After giving us such a run around...
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
At what?
More so than the shark?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
And what about you?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
And why did you drop them?
Why?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Why?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
It was futile. We went all over.
You say that just to flatter me.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
What do you think?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
And where do you find the models?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
I don't see why I should mind.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Is that far from here?
He talked to you Himself?
Through someone else?
Why?
One of the other Sisters?
Who?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Why?
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Love.
Right now?
Did it hurt?
Where did the baby come from?
Agnes...
Would you like to ask them?
No.
No... do you?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
I breathed!
No I'm not.
It came out of me.
No.
Because I wasn't worthy.
No.
What do you feel?
I don't know which one 
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Yes.
What did she mean?
Who?
Where?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Of course you do. Who was it?
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Thanks...
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
When?
I can get you new evidence next week.
Who are you?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
... Thank you.
Obviously there was.
What's your opinion?
So, someone else could have done it.
About two years before.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
Aquittal.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Earthquakes?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
I don't think I care to know.
Bullshit!
You just said...
Nothing...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Long, thin and filtered.
Right...
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Yes I do.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
She is an innocent.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
She didn't want any help.
No!
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Y'what?
Are you now?
Just you?
Yeah?
How about Ding Dong?
Yeah.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
I'll murder that Lennon.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
I'll have a bash.
Yeah, grotesque.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
No, straight up.
I'll look in here again.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
I'm not ...
What's that mean?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is she?
See you.
Out where?
What's that mean?
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
Have they?
Is there a fire, then?
Eh?
You see, sly villains.
But I'm clean.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Hiding.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
You needn't bother.
He started it.
We were going to do it.
What?
Hello.
Is it? Is it really?
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
It's not my fault.
Who?
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
That's too easy for Lennon.
Clever.  George.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
And they want me?
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
Yeah, it's you all right.
Hell, we're equipped --
Dell, plot our location.
I'll see what I can do.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
What's the terrain down there?
Is it solid?
Looks like a derelict.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
God I'm hungry.
Play it for us, please.
Right.  Talk to you.
What?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
Dead.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Right.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
I hope not.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
It wouldn't come.
Ask him.
Careful, don't get under it!
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Good.
Don't be an idiot.
At least it can't get up here now.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
I've completely lost their signal.
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
We can use the flamethrower.
Is it armed?
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Yes, thank heaven.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Are they close?
Look --
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
About four hours.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
What killed it?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Even simple.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Can we get to him?
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Yeah... I forgot.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
I'll get you out of there.
What can I do?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
We're what!?
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Shit.  When?
You win some, you loose some.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Nooooo!
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
What?
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
What's wrong?
Okay.
Auto-shop?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Sounds great.
What is that?
Looks like it.
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Only six?
Check out the tent.
Agreed.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Phoebe.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Why'd call me a killer?
Lloyd and I.
I'm in love with Lloyd!
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
A dull cliche.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
That's how you met me. In passing.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Margo.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Eve! My understudy...
Frankly, I don't remember.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
I take it she read well.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
That's nice.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Everything... everything's so funny...
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
I love you...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Now don't get carried away-
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
What would you like? Texas?
Groom.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
Buy some.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Behind in your dues? How much?
Now you want an argument.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
How did you get in here?
Subway.
You rest. I'll get it...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Karen.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I won't forget.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Thank you, Karen.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
There are other plays...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
The heave-ho.
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
What about Bill?
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
I can't believe Eve said those things!
You'll be there, won't you.
Where'd you get all that information?
That's quite a change of subject.
Now just a minute-
What are you going to wear?
Not much.
Nothing...
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
How do you mean?
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
That's beside the point.
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
How about me what?
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
A couple of weeks.
But what could she do?
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Yeah?
I was sure trying.
The fucking New York Times.
--you do?--with access to records?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--I know, I know--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
--I haven't said anything--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
We're inside the White House now.
It's nothing personal, though. 
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Night.
--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
I didn't do anything wrong.
On the orders of Haldeman?
And?--
--Deep Throat?--
There's always a later plane.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
...No... never in so many words...
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
What do you want to know?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
--this'll only take one second--
My non-denial denial.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
How senior?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
I have nothing more to say.
To where?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
James McCord.
Security consultant.
Government. Recently retired.
No.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
I did all right on McCord.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Haldeman.  Right?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Thanks coach.
-- Thanks, coach --
Sorry, coach.
Like what?
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
You can call me Oz.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Because I want to.
How did you know I was here?
That's nice.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
You called me Oz.
Then don't.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Just in time.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
You fuckin' rule!
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Don't you want me to?
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
No -- Kevin, you?
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Nadia, I can't --
Oh no.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah, are you?
What?!  How do I do that?
What's that?
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
He didn't?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Shut the fuck up.
Just like sex with my wife.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I know. He told me.
A cure?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
Where?
Really.
What?
Well, they are French.
Shit!
And you call me a moron...
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Sure. Don't you?
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Oh no... no....
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Why the fuck would I do that?
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
You fucking liar!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
You must have.
Yes, your highness.
I was all out of dynamite!
Why?
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
Sad?
I'll never let go!
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Ah! Let us begin!
It worked in Odessa...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
No. Empress, you --
I should go
And tell me that she's happy.
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Alvy Singer over here!
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Why not?
Yeah? Allison what?
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Hey, that was last year.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Me? Oh, downtown!
No, Chippewa Falls.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Yeah!
What?
Really?
Oh, all right.
Okay. Yeah.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
M'hm.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
You are extremely sexy.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
U-huh.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Who cares? Who cares?
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
G-go on, I'm interested.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Sinatra?
Yeah?
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Oh.
No.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Yeah.
Oh-
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Commentary.
My head is throbbing.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
Oh, do yuh?
Tell him.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
May I see your license, please?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
M'hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
His wife has diabetes!
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
...of possibly working together.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Oh yes.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
And how's the diva doing?
And you've only just met.
Leo?
Of course.
He's allergic.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
Really?
Oh my God, the sitter.
He's not going tonight.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Harry called.
Monica.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Hey!  Would you?
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
There's still time to undo this.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Just do what I say, alright?
For good.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
It's taken care of.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Well he can't have gone far.
Love?
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
It's a novel.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Okay.
Ah...
Oh, Sally Mae...
Will you make love with me?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Sure.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
I think he's really angry with me too.
A lot of cakes.
And he doesn't smoke?
I'm so sorry.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Clair is a hovering mother.
Well...wow...
I'm sure you understand.
He always has two or three going...
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
You're not serious.
God willing.
Why?
Are you working on a new book?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Really??
If he were still alive, maybe.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
No.  Not something new.
You don't need to thank me.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
What are they?
Evie has a little something for you.
Ah.
Hm.
The both of you.
So how much do you hate her?
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
You weren't exactly horrified.
Neither does Joe.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
You -- you think I'm right?
Yes.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Divinely?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
And do Princesses do improper things?
You did?
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Thank you, sir.
No, sir!
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
...Ants...
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Why?
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
This is a bad day for me.
The mirror -- it's broken.
You don't want me here --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Someone from the office.
As soon as I can walk.
No -- it's my stomach.
Give what up?
A bad insurance risk?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
A what?
Where?
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
That's very wise.
Shut up and deal!
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Gas?
That's very flattering.
That's right, Baxter.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Oh?  Oh!
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
I know how it is.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
What does he mean, accident?
Oh, I'm very grateful.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
I have a vague idea.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Yeah.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Me?
Let me get my bag.
How many pills were in that bottle?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Just as long as she's okay.
Sure.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Happy New Year.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Good night.
The party's over.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Who?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
No.
I don't know.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Let me take that.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
I love you -- remember?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Baxter?
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
Don't you ever stop talking?
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Get out --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
Who are you ?
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Call me what, sir?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
I don't know.
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
We're Americans.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Signs?
What is it?
Looks pretty shallow.
Too far inland.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Charlie?
Okay, Willard, sit down.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Do you know that jungle?
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Music?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
Yes, I know.
No -- no, sir.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
You can't have water after morphine.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
No -- leave it --
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
Why?
What is this bridge?
Why did they attack us?
His name is...
I should be checking on the boat.
What things?
I do.
Anyone got a card?
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
23   CONTINUED:  
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
139  CONTINUED:
157  CONTINUED:
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
26   CONTINUED:  
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
I'm staying.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
My home is here.  With you.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
New to the country, kid?
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
A daughter in Oregon.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
-- Turn around.
You got one?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Don't bet on it.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Shut up!
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Sure.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Get the fuck out of here.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
They'll have to come right past us.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
I love you.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
His home number.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
His name?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Thank you.
What's that got to do with it?
Welcome.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Never.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Were you asleep?
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Stop staring. Do a vase.
All right, cut me a break.
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
What's he look like?
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
Never a break. Never.
You consider your life easy.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I'm coming.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Absolutely not.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Just a second -- he has to go.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?  What's okay?
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
What?
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
The contract?
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
'Them'?
We don't have a choice.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
What do you want to know?
You were like a boy genius?
Why not?
Then you went freelance?
Yes.
After that?
That's fiction.
Nothing.
Oh.  What do you think about?
Okay.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except --
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
For Nicholai?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I'm sure you will.
It can be.
She was taken.
Martin.
Right.
Oh, God.  I see it!
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Sometimes.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Sure.
I have all day.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
It's big, right Jahn?
We could make a run for it?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Tough break.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
But how did the wall get here?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Am I late?
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
No, not yet.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
What?
I fell in love.
She's cool.
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
He got that one right.
What happened?
You're kidding.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Lucky break!
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
Yes.
Yeah, maybe.
Ooh, well excuse me.
Whatever!
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Don't worry it's okay!
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
No way Doug, I can't.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
There's nothing there for me.
But I love you!
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
No, it should be over soon.
We don't need you.
Thanks.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
No, just a coffee.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Guests.
Uh-huh!
Cool!
Fuck you!
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
But I have to finish this....
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
What for?
Why?
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
You bastard!
We're not sure...
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Very well.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I don't want his money.
That's over. Way over.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
Thanks.
I could take after Dad, too.
I meant he's a doctor.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I need to whizz.
I don't want to have any conversation.
-- This play means a lot to me.
Like me.
So you agree you need help?
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Don't you?
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
No.
Fun.
You're sometimes not sure?
I was twelve.
Mars.
What about your father?
That what you do?
Pull over.
That I want you to take me home.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Yes.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Ever again.
Your parents are divorced?
Praying.
I'm not tired.
In there.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
She did. It was you.
Please.
You came here to give me my report card?
Thank you.
A similar triangle?
Scalene?
I beg your pardon?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Oh yeah.
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
You do?
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
In the parking lot, with her.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Shhhhhhhh!
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
You know me?
Marty.
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
What do you call this? 
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
They come with the house.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Sure thing. Come on.
Tom...
Thanks.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
What're you doing?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Yeah. I can imagine.
No.
There you go.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Yeah.
Don't ask me.
What?
How bad off is he?
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
How's he doing?
Yeah.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Yeah.
Yes.
Stay as long as you like.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Beats me.
Wanta sue me?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Arachtoid.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
I have a radio fix...
No!  Ditto the professor-
Flying to Cambodia.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. ÂI'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Please, Barton.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
...Who is this?
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
A week, eight, nine days Â
I...
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Who?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies Â though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York Â hopefully our numbers are growing Â who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths Â not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
See you, Charlie.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor Â though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong Â Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Charlie, I'm in trouble Â something horrible's happened Â I've gotta call the police...
I've gotta call the police Â or you could call for me Â
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on Â just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
I'm at the Earle.
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
I apologize, Barton.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Mr. Lipnik.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was Â well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink Â you're a goddamn write-off.
Must be.
What Â
The others are being sent.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
Only fry you once.
How's about it, Bart?
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Yeah.
When did you start drinking again?
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
Did you find out about her parents?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you quit.
Nilsen.
Sometimes I really hate you.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
Only when they make interesting reading.
It won't last.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
No.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Fine.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
No.
Try me.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
No thank you.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Nilsen?
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I got tired of being played with.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I know what that's like.
Why the hell not?
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
I don't believe it.
Catherine told me what was in it.
I'm going with you.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
She killed him.
It was an accident.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Did you check all four years?
He was shot.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Let's get out of here.
Do you ever get sick of it?
The whole thing Â painting.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Oh, I didn't know that.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
What's wrong?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
How do you know?
I need a dealer.
They're just words.
Yes, but as a black painter Â
You're not?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
For real?
I ain't John Henry.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
I guess it was a long time ago.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
Stand still.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Jean Michel Basquiat.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I'm -- sorry, I --
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Maybe you're right.
I'm tempted.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Treat to be here.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Yes and no...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Oh no, those things frighten me.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Coming on line now, sir.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
You'd be surprised.
What are you talking about?
Divide and conquer.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
I hate being lectured.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I wish I knew.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Well...um...her.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
I find that unlikely.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I've got to stop him.
What do you mean?
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Dr. Meridian...
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Recognition, of course.
Mystery.
How ya doin', Al?
Just checking, young sir.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Just ones this beautiful.
Not much.
That's usually my line.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
What?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I'm not-
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
I don't want to remember!
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Bruce, you can't.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
I got family. ...Please.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Miss.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
... Very good, sir.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
What are you talking about?
I won't let you have it.
I loathe bats.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Finding out where she is.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
WHAT??
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
I've considered that possibility.
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
What?  I improved her a little...
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Hi.....  Roses.
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Uh ... yes ...
Excuse me.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Well, Ahm....
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
She's ... well, she's good.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Er ... pray tell me why?
Certainly is.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
A car sounds sensible.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
The TV.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
And Boot-Head.
Heh heh. Yeah.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Me first!
Huh huh huh.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Cut it out butt-hole!
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Huh? Huh huh.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
Where are his pants?
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Won't?  Or can't?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
That's all we need.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Just a hunch.
3:30 I guess.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
And live in what, our station wagon?
I think so.
Good girrrl!
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
You've got to help them.
... I will.

There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
I'm lonely.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Any particular kind?
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
I don't know.
Why not?
The attic.
... Straight out?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Thank you.
It's fine today, Robert.
Thank you, Robert.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Thank you.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Yes. I am.
Your family doctor?
Hello, Eve.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
I am a very good gardener.
Good night, Eve.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
No, thank you.
I see.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Thank you, Eve.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
No. I'm not busy.
I have nothing more to say.
I see.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
... I see.
Yes. You look very sick.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes, Ben - he is.
No, Ben.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Oh, I see.
Yes. I like to watch.
What sort of bed is it?
It's very sore.
Of course. I would like to look.
... Good evening, Louise.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes.
I hope so.
Yes.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... Oh, really...
Try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
No, that won't do any good.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Right, Chief.
No, sir.
Yeah.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
May 11th.
Hmmm.
She's very beautiful.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. WeÂll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
What's that?
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
That... was... no... simulation.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Schwartz.
Forget it.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Yessir.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain ÂdoorsÂ which should never be opened.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
You're a fag or a liar.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
No.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Sure. It'd be fun.
My God.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Ha ha ha!
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
But I think I have another plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Says who?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I love you, Lotte.
One hour.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
Not like He punished me.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Yes?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Yes ma'am..
Well, what can you do?
Extra?
No, let her rest.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Go upstairs I said!!
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Her who?
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Never found out.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Oh, nothin', you know.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
ANTI-SEMITE!
Nothing.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
That fucking bitch!
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Well--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
I'm not really, uh.
Different mothers, huh?
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
In the briefcase?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
On you, maybe.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
I thought you might know, man.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Now I got--
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
So Dieter has the money?
Maude?
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
I want a child.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Am I wrong!
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh?
What the fuck are you--
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey Walter--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
It's your roll--
It's your roll.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
The nail polish, Walter.
What about the toe?
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Dude--
No, I'm--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Hey, cool it Walter.
No Dude.
Wha.
Dude, I'm sorry--
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Shit!
Who is this?
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
Right, Dude.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Well. . . yeah.
Help me put him back in his chair.
I said out.  Now.
Stay away from me, mister!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
Then who does he work for?
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Thought you were dead.
Too bad you're out of it.
Human?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
You experimented on your own, son?
Two so far.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Us?  What are you talking about?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Don't even start, old man.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
Watch me.
Frost!!!
Who is LaMagra?
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
For them. But for me --
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Perhaps.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Closer.
Trying to find the energy.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Mrs. Leavitt--
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Not the only things missing, Nick.
That's a joke?
--Nick!!
--whatever; that's her.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Why is there no "our" here?
Get your goddamn--
--you should get back into bed.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
Whatever you want.
Why?
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
You have to go.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
Turn the tapes back on.
--go!
--fuckin' A right--
I do.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
What?
Butt-ugly owl.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Don't have one.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
Fucking owl!
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
Anna's the witch.
What?
This isn't about us.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
I think it's time to get out of here.
What're you nuts--
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
What?
That's why she kills children.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Whatever.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
--it's urgent!
--the Sheriff's Office--
No.
I am?
No, I--
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Thanks.
Abby--
You're bad.
I said you're bad.
Yeah.
...What do you mean?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Marty.
I don't follow baseball.
I own the place.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Back where?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
Got a job for you.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
For the money.
Ya catch any fish?
...What kind of fish?
Got something to show me first?
Of course.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Meurice...
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
What?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Only you. and the photo lab.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Alright, suit yourself.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey nothing.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Then you got undressed.
No. Come on.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I . I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
See my nipples?
No. please. I won't.
No. What is happening?
Don't say that.
O.K.
Yeah. hurry up though.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Hello.
Frank is coming?
I sure don't hate you.
Whatiya mean?
Yes.
Does that scare you?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
I want you to stay with me.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Go where?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Yes.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Maybe so.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I'll drink to that.
Okay, okay. Bye.
Yes.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Okay, Sandy.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
No.
What is it?
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead!
Hey Jeff.
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
I'll get a coat for her.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
... Stop it Mike.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
What?
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
What is?
What is?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Yes, I am.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
We want some grass.
No.
It's your grass.
No.
It's your grass.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
For calling you a homo.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Because I got caught.
Because they caught me?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Okay.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Actually, it was three.
Yes, it is.
Power?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
And Diego?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
I'll tell her.
That was a beautiful message.
Tuna.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Tuna.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Kristina's fine.
Are we gonna split up?
How are you doing?
You can call me Dad if you want.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
But I've got school.
Swear on my life.
I know, Dad.  I know...
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Who's the co-pilot?
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Yes, I am.
What?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
That's right.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
Don't be such a pussy.
And here?
I understand. What's your question?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sail.
Don't move, Hacene.
Sure. By shooting at me.
I don't even know your name yet ...
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
Here?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Good evening, sir.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Of course I am.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
Yes.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
No.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No -- never.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
I had some papers to pick up.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Yeah.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
About a year and half ago.
Yes.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
She left me.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Yes -- several times.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
You called him?
No.
No.
Yes.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
We dated for about a month last year.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Yes -- cocaine.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
A.M -- or P.M.?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
You didn't know about it before that?
You know I can't talk about that.
Yes.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
No pain, no gain?
I thought the subject was sex?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
I know.
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What would?
Of course.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
That wasn't the deal.
Why?
Yeah.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
He could let you have your vacation.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yes.
I'll talk to him later.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
That's too bad.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
What time did you leave?
We were here two Christmases ago.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
That's it.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
No.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
No, your kids.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
But I... We don't even know each other.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
You want to go back in?
What?
Yes.
Do you want to leave your husband?
What made you ask such a question?
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Yeah. See you later.
I want you to come.
Couple. Want to help?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Have you ever been to that station?
Why?
Trouble. Why?
I had a temper.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, what is this?
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
No one's asking you to!
For who?
Then he can move! People move!
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Hmm?
Nah.
I don't remember!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
WHAT!
What the hell you talking about?
Go for it.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
That's some terrible shit.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
I have to finish this for class.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Mother!  No.
You moved into this block?
I manage them.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
I can't!
You got the shit?
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Daddy?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
No thanks.
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
What are you going to do with it?
There's no time.
Why?
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
All right, Caesar.
The money?  The money's gone.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
You betrayed me!
I'm listening.
Yes, I understand.
Pretty good, sir.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
What?  They ain't there?
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
All right.
...  thank you.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
A beer.  Of course.
No.
Maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Tell me about it.
You have to ask?
I'm already in your bed.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
He was in love with you, right?
For what?
He hung it up.
Does the case lock?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Violet?
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
Right.
Look, maybe I should just...

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Really.
Yes.
Okay.
I hadn't heard.
Oh, Jesus... 
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I won't hurt you.
I know that.
I don't know.
What?  Like amnesia?
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
I don't know.
I was shot twice in the back.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I can't believe I slept.
Go ahead.
...omigod, no...
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Nykwana Wombosi. 
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
Go back to the hotel.
xxxxxx
Think I could rent a scooter?
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
What have you done to my flat?
...ditioning.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
...sabotage!
I'm waiting for my daddy.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Beginner's luck.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
No, no ... I did that...
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
SAM! What a surprise!
Ah ...
Am I?
So how ...?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Why?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Do you know what you're doing.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
What?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
Oh.
It's you ... it's you ...
Don't look back! Act naturally!
No.
Them?
What?
Looking for you.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
I thought you arrested me.
Let go! We've got to stop!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Go away.
Where are you going?
Here.
You are good to me Sam.
I delivered it.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Yes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You haven't switched it on.
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
This isn't rare!
Um ...
Er, yes ...
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Thank you for calling Cen -
What? Who is this?
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
We'll be back.
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
What?
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Mary ...
Got a beer?
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
He's going to be all right, right?
What's his name?
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
You never know.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
You look so different.
I think it looks good.
How is she?
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
The ghosts--
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
It's coming.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
A medical miracle.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
I never felt better in my life.
Better bring it all.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Who with?
Why?
No shit.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You really think so?
You sure?
Nice, Jane.
You've made my dreams silly.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Why?  What did they do to you?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Yes.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Did you shoot their boots?
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Good.
I didn't know you were going with him.
No.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
No!!!!!
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Really?
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Stop it.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
Almost immediately.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Yes.
We could...
He said something about...
Should I...
Follow me.
One's enough.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Okay.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
I don't know.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Fill for a second.
I like "godsend."
I trust you.
Hey?
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
What do you mean clean?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Why, you need me for the story?
Uh-huh.
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
Good.  That's it...See you.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Well, when?
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Then you should stay here.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
Oh yeah?
What, right now?
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Oh it's enough...
Honest?
Me too.
Oh...
Yes Walter.
Every word...
Thank you.
Hm...
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
What are you trying to say?
Why not?!
Is it?  I've forgotten.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Don't ask.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I do the research.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
A parakeet?
What, Mr. De Santis?
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Just wait till you see this!
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I can't talk right now.
No...look I'm busy...
Uh, sure.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
You're like an undercover guy!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
You are?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Why not?
I thought you didn't respect money!
Really?
I can't.  I gotta go home.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
Then let me give you something then...
Gee.  Thanks.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I was just straightening up the place.
I had him in my grasp.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Amazing!
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Down there.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Eeyuu.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Yeah?
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.
Hi.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
I am so sure.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
A dress.
For the dance.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
I'm glad you came.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Like my homework.
Nice ensemble!
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
I have cheerleading squad.
We'll cover it later.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Your turn.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
And where are they now?
They don't even have Dolby.
Oh.
Could be.
Jeffrey!
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Well, I hope so.
What is she...
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Like you've got a grip.
Right.
I am.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Switch nostrils?
A little better.
You can't seduce me.
Yes I do...
I did.
You don't have to...
I think I'm ready for the Show.
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
You okay?
I heard already.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
He looks great, just great!
He'll learn.
Oh let's not...
You need a nickname.
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Beg me!
Beg me again!
You're a cocksucker!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
Naw...
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Annie's a smart lady.
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
C ' mon!
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
Fear and ignorance.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Crash, shut the door.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
We're eight and sixteen.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Why are you doing this to me?
Liar.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Speeding?
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Honey, come here.
Four aces, Doc.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
In so many words, yes.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Hey.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Yeah.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
It's none of my business?
I see you, you motherfuckers.
No, a...
What people?
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Yeah.
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
Well...
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
No, Ace.
Ace, listen to me.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Certainly.  Senator.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Oh, no.
Who's this?
Thanks a lot.
I - I - I...
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
No, he didn't.
Yeah, how do I know?
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
What do you mean?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Pretty serious.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I threw it away.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
What'd you have?
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
You get down here!
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Oh, you are...
But it was just mine.
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
A record of the arrests...
Can't do it with both hands?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
You can't talk to me like...
Please.
I can't.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Nicky, I did -
Nicky, I'm sorry.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Is that the last one?
I'm over here now.
Calm down! Calm down!
Stay out of the way!
For what?
How are you?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Yeah.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Bye.
I don't - 
Okay.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, you are.
Come on. Don't be scared.
A sponsor.
It's what you want?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
What's the matter?
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Get lost?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
You do?
Here.
No, I'm gonna drive.
Are they out now?
All right.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Boy, look at this place, huh?
All right.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Get up.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Remo.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Fuck you!
How you doin'?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
I'm sorry.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Yeah.
Having a good time?
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
I wonder..
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
I lied.
She has a real spirit.
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
It may be time to get the police involved...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Winning.
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
You can't get away with..
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
But I'm blind.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Trust me, you won't have to.
Thanks.
This is one way.
Don't you have children?
Taking messages.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
I didn't hurt you.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
Theo wants to talk again.
Then whose is it?
You could've killed us.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Why would I do that?
Or relieve me of it later.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I improved on the fucking original.
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
Then hang up!  Do it!
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
That makes two of us.
The one in Brentwood.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Are you okay?
Your husband?
You're all three of you in that van?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
They put their hands all over me.
Hand me the phone.
I thought it was inspired.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
259-7881.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Why are we stopping?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
There are no guarantees in this life.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Got a phone in that van?
Stay there.
Talk to the man.
My pleasure --
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Put the girl on.
Better reassure him.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Are you busting my chops or what?
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
From here on, I dish it out.
She's not a girl, Col --
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Hi.
Saw it, Dil.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
It's Dave.
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
What?
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Not in my experience.
Scottish?
Like treacle.
Not me.
You know.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
They're jealous.
I wonder.
Like what?
Must be.
Jesus.
Must be in love to manage that.
Did you do that to him?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
Something I heard someone say once.
Must be.
Make it up to me, then.
When?
Know what, honey?
Sorry.
Probably.
Okay.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Afraid so.
Yes.
Yes.
For me.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
I was trying to get out of something.
You knew which man?
You knew my Jody?
He asked me to see were you all right.
Stop it, Dil --
Fergus.
Tell me what she wore.
Do I?
I promise.
Stop it, Dil --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
Do you want some food?
He's hot.
Leave me alone, Jude.
I heard.
I know.
Suits you.
Yes.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
You know what. Go.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
I told him.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
And do you know why?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
I understand.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Can't we take it off?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
No. It's the truth.
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Why did you sign up?
Hurry up, would you?
Don't be so sure.
I told you not to talk that way --
Tell me something, anything.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Why?
Got to catch me first --
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
He believes in the future --
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
That's right.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
You're going to look for him -- now?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Can you remember anything at all?
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
I'm through listening to you!
Reggie -- listen to me --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Agent.
So that was it.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Because they're still here.
Agents.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Describe him.
That's not Carson Dyle.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Me? Why me?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Next, please.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
The last one, please.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
No.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Okay -- up there.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
It's all right with us --
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
There must be some way.
Come here.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
You did.
I think I love you, Alex --
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm scared.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
It's a start, anyway.
Well!
Go on.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
Tell me what?
Stop it!
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Up there! I would put it up there!
No, Jean-Louis.
Why, do you think we're going to?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Yes.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
The man and the woman are married --
Starting tonight?
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
Where?
How would you like a spanking?
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
How do you know what they're doing?
Words can hurt very much.
Wha -- what do you want?
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
The American Embassy.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Oh la vache!
He took care of Charlie for us.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
No I wasn't.
Run!
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
No. I'll handle this.
Are you sure?
She's still a virgin.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
She works at a church?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.

I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Of course I'm scared.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Does she fuck?
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Twenty eight years ago.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
I'm fine.
I'll think about it.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
That's not why we broke up.
What?
And the police did nothing?
Who was the fourth?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
Are you Jody?
I got to go.
No, you keep one.
Ok.
Told you to hide it.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
ROD!
Okay, okay.

Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
That's right.
A ruler?
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
Thanks.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Honest?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Oh, my, yes.
Just bring your checkbook.
I think I'll kill her.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Curly, where's your car?
I've been wanting to meet you.
The apple core club.
Who?
No.
Didn't you call?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Of course.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Do you know where she might be?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
What do you mean?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Oh... thank you.
A check?
How did you find out?
Did he know?
That your maiden name?
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
No.
No, I think I'd remember.
Is that unusual?
Yeah.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Your eye.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
He owns it. You know?
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
I want to see her.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
With us.
He didn't wear bifocals.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
I think I got something.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Yes...
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Well, no.
Never.
Si.
What about the water?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Since lunch.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing Â apple core.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
I'm working for his daughter.
Well, you never know, do you?
You don't say?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Why? What do you mean?
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
No...
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
OK...
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...

I know.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
It didn't end very well, did it?
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
That looks pretty nice.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Yes.

Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Hello, Bernstein.
Are they standing for me?
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
You really don't know who I am?
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
You can't stop me.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir. 
Can't say, sir.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yes?
Charlie -
Charlie -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Look out that window.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
Why is she leaving me?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
What do you mean by that?
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
You won't be lonely, Charles...
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
That must have been love.
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Good!
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
What about that apartment?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Am I sure about what?
You're shittin' me.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
I take it she likes the guy.
He went home to change for the big date.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
Awww. That was so cute.
I can't believe you're here.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
What?
But can we date?
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
He's your fiancĂŠ.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Oh God...
Just me.
We did.
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
I can pass!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Are you open?
What's your point?
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Why?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That's cheating?
She called you Brad?
That girl was vile to you.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
You think things would be any different now?
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
There's more?
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
Wait.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let's hear it.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
What?
Can we not talk about this?
Exactly. They drank it all.
No, you're not.
It's today.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
I swear.
I never tried it.
Listen to you.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Exactly.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
Because I'm here.
I'm not.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I'll read the book.
Could be.
This life.
What responsibility?
As if it's that easy.
Oh, like your life's any better?
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
You need a ride?
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Excuse me?
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
Veronica.
She's my girlfriend.
I'm trying.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why do you say that?
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Why do you say that?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'm going to class.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Veronica, I love you...
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Can I have your name please?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
He's your cousin?
No way.
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Because he's out of shape.
Yeah!
That's sick, Dante.
I hope it feels good.
How long you gonna be here?
You're gonna be at John K's party?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Which one?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
That woulda been cool.
More bang for the buck.
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
Hal will have my head for this.
What usually eats a banana?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Love's a killer, isn't it?
You're getting warmer!
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
My pleasure.
Not on that leg.
Hi, Gabe.
Fine, I guess...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
We spent a night there one night...
I don't think you do.
I don't expect you to understand.
Why are you yelling?
Flare up of old emotions...
From one professional to another, of course.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Jess--you look good.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Get it!
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
How far?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Sue me.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
I've been cured.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Thank you, sir.
No. She's dead!
How do you do, sir?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Well, shall we get down to it?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Oh, aye, aye.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Fine. Fine.
I haven't seen you before.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Yes.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Sir.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Travel...and things.
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
Yes.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
Then let's have it.
Federal?
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Can you finish on schedule?
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
I don't know...
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
I've been calling and calling.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
Jesus, what is with this guy?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
You're cool.
With what?
It's not me.
What?
I think so.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
What'd he do to you?
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Why?
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
I never learned jazz.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Oh, I'm captivated.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
You had to kill Heller?!
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
What's at Union Station?
One more.
You're full of shit.
What'd they do?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
The guy came right at us!
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Yeah.
Who?
Is this your dad?
How'd he die?
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Okay, I will.
What?
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Where are we going, Jerry?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I'm leaning toward no.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
And what did I say?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Working.
Not today...
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I was just thinking that.
Yeah, I do.
Where do you think Jerry is?
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
What?
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
I'm willing to take that risk.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
No, thanks.
Oh?  How's he doing?
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
No doubt.
With me.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
This... seemed best.
Good luck, David.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
You want to classify prime numbers?
Is that your official response?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
But what do I say?
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Okay.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
That's my girl...  Lights.
It's so... small.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The systems integration site.
-- of Hadden Industries.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
And?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Jesus --
It's really happening.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Can you try?
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
It's getting late...
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
The final countdown.
Please --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
But --
Recommendations?
Have your department make a full report.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
You steal a car?
Git to work!
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
You jes' watch us!
Tramp! Beautiful!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
I call.
What happened? How far did you get?
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
On my own.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
You just said he could eat anything.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Call.
Cuter.
Kick a buck.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
What are you talking about?
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
She don't want it.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Who was the man in the basement?
You know where.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
How do you know that?
Nothing.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
That's no surprise.
Then what do you need me for?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Yes.  I have to go...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Oh, I know.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Let's get out of here...
My promise.
Shut up.
Right.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
You got a suspect...
Or the F.B.I.?
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
And her husband? What was he?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
It does.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Yes.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
No.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
Where are you?
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
There's nothing to tell.
Really?
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'd have to see it on.
You look beautiful.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Come on.
You've only known Jake a few months.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
You too, Mom.
When did you start smoking?
Mom, please.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Not even if it's something positive?
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
There's a spider in my room.
Lie?
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I'm glad.
No.
That must be really difficult.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
Who do you think you are?
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Very romantic setting.
So are you engaged, or what?
The left one.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
No rounds for another three hours.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
No, I need some serious household advice.
Open up.    I want to see.
You like it?
No.
You, too. Kick ass today.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
I think I should call someone.
Letty, please.
What do you want to do?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
I don't feel like going to work today.
No, it's not like that.
You just need to get more organized. L
Can you loan me a 20?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
That's a big question.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
So, what do you say, Let?
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I've met someone else.
No.
I love him.
Do you know who this is?
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Where did they go?
It's Elvis...
You're there now?
You're calling me on is phone?
What?
It's Daniel.
Good.   I'm good.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
I'm good.   Really.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
I guess we're going to find out.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
You want me to help you get out of the country?
I know they won't be home tonight.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
No problem.
I'm not any closer than you are.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
What about the money?
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I think he's already figured that out.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
We had a deal.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What is it you do, Sami?
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
What?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
Take a nap.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
No.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
I owe you nothing.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
What do you think?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Come and get it if you can.
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
But Wudan does not accept women.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
We must avenge mother!
What does it say?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
Care for a hot dog?
No onions?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
You don't say.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Fun -- look at that guy...
I dabble.  May I?
Who?
I think he's yours, now.
In a better place.  I hope.
She's still dead.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
I don't know you...
Take the dope, too.
You don't even remember...
I can see her.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Your pain ends now.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Very well, it's your ass.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
On my mother's life.
Junior.
No.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
No.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
A friend wrote me.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
What? Another letter from your friend?
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Wait, don't hang up.
I will.
Yes it does.
No.
Why are you doing this?
Yes.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Get off me.
Hi.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
I don't know.
Why?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
I don't know.
Well did you like it?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
That's one way of looking at it.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
I want to go home.
I swear.
Good night Cecile.
I know.
I do.
It works a little.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Who is this?
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald?
No.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Even there?
I'm working on it.
What's your problem?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Where'd she go?
Kind of.
Oh yes.
It was... Fantastic.
And that's why you're leaving?
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Well done.
Get out!
I'll do my best.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
Excuse me?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
You bastard!
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
But it's already come true.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
All right, mommy.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
It's early yet.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
What?
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
I'll show you.
I didn't forget.
It's true.
It was just a voice.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
Because she is my friend.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But...
No.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Oh, thank you, Amy.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, please!
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong Â warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
That's the clever way to do it.
Will you come soon?
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
But she's such a nice lady.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
No, thank you.
Then I'll tell you a story Â a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Good.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Now, I don't know Amy --
We'll see that she gets there in good time
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Your lips look delicious.
No, it was another woman.
Good. Except for PMS.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Anything's better than Mark.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
So don't look in his eyes.
People notice you Frida.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
I don't know.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Give him the tampon test.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
I haven't gotten it yet.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Why not? There's been a murder.
What? Why'd you do that?
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
You should have seen it erect.
No.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
Well, whattdaya think?
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
You never say that.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
So pay them back and apologize.
Did you change your hair?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Intriguing?
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
I'm sorry.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
A man killed in Central Park.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
No, I got it. It's okay.
No, but thanks for the warning.
Okay.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, take it.
What makes you think I was the last one?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Take some allergy medicine.
You're some catch Lloyd.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
He tried to kill me!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.  This way.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnĂ­t with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howĂ­s your mother?
A hunch.  He might be able to...
IĂ­ll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I see...
Patricia Crenshaw.
I didnĂ­t requisition a secretary.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
IĂ­m sorry...
Why, yes.
Don't know much, do you?
Yes.
It must be a closet or something.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
But I...
Wait, this isn't fair...
Shut up!
You know something about me?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Yes.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
I have to go...
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
I'm...  being...  punished.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Don't worry about it.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What the hell is this ?
) Listen, you little...
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Exactly. A condition.
What about containment, Alan?
Is that everybody?
Fine.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
I'm going to kill him.
Bob...
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
The government
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
That'd be great.
Extend things?
Oh my gosh...
Oh, yeah... probably...
I don't think so.
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
She knows.
Why?
Oh... Thanks.
Fertility beads.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
What do you mean?
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
Really?
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
We'd like to hire you.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
I had a feeling.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
Well...
What's wrong with a magic trick?
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Mind if I sit down?
You1re leaving, too?
Truman used it all the time.
I don't mind.
I run a temp agency.
Yeah... Bedtime.
What?
I know.
We're doing our best, sir.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Look.
Come on.
The tunnel.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Datura.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
Ain't no place safe.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
Come on. Let's go.
What you wanna do?
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
In the battle, sir.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Doing fine, sir.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
Sure.
I'm in.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
No.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Stop what?
Huh?
Knox!  what are you doing here?
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Are you going with Chet?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
I didn't know you taught.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Isn't there an easier way?
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
You have another choice.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Good luck.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Yes sir.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
My brother went here.
Nothing.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
This play?
Yes.
He's the owner...
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
You're going to have to get a new one.
I told you...
I saved your life is what I did!
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
You people...rich people...
On the side!!
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Keep tasting...
A little to the left...
One whistle... Start the engine...
Nothing.
John...
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
Damn right!
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
It is too! Now you passed it!
You're full of shit.
They did not!
Yeah.
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Who? Who is?
I know! I fuckin' know!
It won't open.
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Where? Where is he?
You talk to him?
You are frightened, no?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
I came to see Merle.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Linda, yeah.
Naw.
Yeah?
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Who's got the ammo?
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
No?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Sure.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Up north.
No. No, no.
Right here.
Right here.
Right.
So do I.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Hell no!
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What else?
More bullets in the gun?
You wanna bet?
No!!!?
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
That's my plan.
See you Monday.
I gotta get back, Nick.
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
It's not socks, Sal.
Naw.  Uh-huh.
Sure.
Up.
Up.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Fuck you - fuck you.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
When you bring in Doucet.
You're crazy.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Technothugs.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
That cost me two weeks' pay.
No, sir.
Simulated one.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Take a look at this.
They always are.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
Jabez! Careful --
Thank you, Belle --
He lied to me again.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
And serve him right!
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Howdy, Hank.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
-- of what happens after we die!
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
I'm through with you.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Yes -- at midnight.
Well, I --
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Headache -- Squire?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
Well -- yes --
Coming.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Jabez!
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Tired?
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Isn't that your own fault?
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
Jabez!
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
I say -- it don't matter.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
You'll be a father any minute now.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
It's all right, Sheriff.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
I won't forget.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
I object.
Why don't you?
But meant her moving here.
Mind if I play some tunes?
That is Christmas music.
John.
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
I told you...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Holly Gennero?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
Bullshit.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Yeah.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Ooohh....
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Yeah.  So how are you?
I'm sorry...
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Why you going to Algeria?
I like that... yeah!
What?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
You don't have a choice?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I can't talk to him.
I'm afraid.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I got Sal.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
I frisk you?
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
They were ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
He's all doped up.
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
It's all we got.
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
Mulvaney...
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I don't know.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
Would I hire you?
Why not?
What now, Sonny?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Howard!
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You stopped?  Why?
Yes...

Get over there!
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
Have him walk in backwards.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
You follow my car. 
They're beautiful ...
Sonny - Here's your document.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?

What?
Ask Sal.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
What makes Sammy run?
You got a deal.
I'm in here.
How are you holding up in this weather?
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Whew!
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Him no white.  Him no white.
Tonight, when we close.
Here, you gotta delivery.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Sal, I want my money.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
You keep it.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Make dat money.  Get paid.
I can't be staying long anyway.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Trust me.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Meda.  Meda.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Tina, I'll be right back.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.

Don't start on me today.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Yeah, I think.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
HARRY Dunne.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I don't follow.
I know I am, Mom.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Peg leg?
Exactly! A pirate!
Welcome to public school, my friend.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Put some ice on it.
And my mouph is frozen.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Shut up!
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
No. What happened?
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I lugged it all over town!
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Roger that, Wilco.
Right.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
Let's just do it and get out of here.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Skateboard.
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
That's the downside. There is none.
Uh-oh. Harry?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
But we don't drink from the house do we.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Wow, you are smart.
Who's there?
What?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry Gurney.
My Lord?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Where are we do you think?
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Yes...
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Long live the fighters!
You feel the flesh crisping?
What is it?
Where?
What can be done has been done.

No.  I never drink -- wine.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
I don't understand.
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
I didn't feel well...
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
Eddie, you screwed up.
Really?
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Eddie, how was I?
I don't know.  Where?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Rolling.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Rolling.
This is the big moment...!
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
It's that easy?
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
You got the job?!!
I don't know.  It's so much money...
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
What other sixty-thousand?
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Raising money is tough.
Would that work?
Da pleasure be mine.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Tits.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Who?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Maybe it needs special handling.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh, hi.
Not good...
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
Well you tried --
You don't wanna be noticed?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Isn't that the same thing?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Anything good?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
No.
Al!
Cool.
No, uh...
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
What if Shari's the dream?
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
We're falling behind.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Right, right...
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Mm.
He says --
Mom?
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
She left.
What are you talking about?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
You batted or you bunted?
Welcome to work, Ed.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Oh... how come?
Well, when you put it that way.
Can't we just --
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
The what?
I know, I ...
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Come on, let's go.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Come on...
Are you all right?
The what?
What?
What is?!
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
What?
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
It's me, Ed.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
You brought the cameras here!
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
pierde.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Here, get down.
Anything wrong?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
What?
Dick... Dick,..
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Ethics are...
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Right
You bet.
Good luck, Tracy.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Sporty.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
That sounds good.
Take as much room as you want
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Walt needs to see you.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Door was open.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Should we get a what?
Still clear?
We'll let it run awhile
Three twenty-five.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Yeah.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
I know.
Sorry.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
For what?
What do you mean?
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Don't you fucking knock?
What'd I do?
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yes.  But do you know?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
It's Lynn.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
That simple, huh?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
Homicide?  A detective?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Look at a picture for me.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
No!  Please leave!
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
More.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Dogs got no reason to live.
Man, what're you saying?
They shot him in his library.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Answer yes or no.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
I'll break them, sir.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Why?
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
That's right.
I want you to follow Bud White.
What?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
Bud White's been here?
What's her name?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Officer White?
Under the house.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Yeah, it's subtle.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Please hold, Sergeant...
Yeah.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Why?
A direct one.
I don't know who he is.
Really?
Who was that other guy?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
You told me no calls.
Why'd you leave?
Oh my God...
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Listen--
What if--
Not particularly, no.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
What are you saying?
Oh my God.
I'm married.
Why?
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Somebody took my blender.
Something bad happened tonight.
I saw a man die.
Robert--
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Yes.
Just reporters.
What happened to your head?
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
That's gonna end tonight.
Don't count on it.
He doesn't work that way.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
Yeah.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
--otherwise we may have to--
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Did they take your clothes?
Usually they take clothes.
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Bobby--
Why would the NSA--
Jerry?
Go fuck yourself.
Bobby--
Yeah.
You would?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
What the hell does it mean?
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
Hiding something?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
He's clever. He had help.
Dean's with Lyle.
What about the tape?
Do you have visual?
What's your ETA?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
Yes sir.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
I don't want to go back.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
Excuse me?
He said - be careful.
I do not.
I'd like you to have them.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
I believe you still have my book.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. AlmĂĄsy nods.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
Don't go over it again, please.
You will.  You will.
No.
What?
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
I know.
You too.  Good luck!
Appropriate?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Sorry, what's your point?
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
No.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Are you Hana?
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
I don't know what that means.
Please don't creep around this house.
And you've forgotten yours.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Oh really?
Aren't you?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
I can already see.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Your friend?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Really?  That's sudden.
Why?  Is he staying?
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
No!
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
He's sleeping.
Does he have to go?
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
A bit of one.
This is making me incredibly angry.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
Then you were married?
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
I'm in the middle.
Uh. I'm showing off.
No you can't.
How about if you try disappearing.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Give him the card.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
In a week.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
That's because I wanted them to!
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Let's just see how we do.
We are...for the tools.
Yes you did.
A dozen times.
Thank you.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Got it.
It's your mistake.
Get the hell in.
Okay, 80-20--
I'd taken the Mask?
Right. The eight billion.
Where the money is.
And the money goes--
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Feeling old?
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
Surgically attached.
Have really held you under?
No way.
Get out of here!
What about you?
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
Remind me why.
Check out my ball.
You know where my loyalties lie.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
What do you think?  What's this?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
You're a lawyer?
Right.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
They did?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
For what?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Any school you want.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
You're not gonna be there.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
Say you were wrong.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Take it.
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Did he say why?
And ...?
What do you mean?
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Well I hate it.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
You got more than one?
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
Thanks for reminding me.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
What do you want, a joke?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Mm-hm.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Have you been logging on?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Yeah.  Who are you?
What?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
What happened?
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Sit down, and shut up!
I'm going to see what it is.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Or you ran into something ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Would you please stop calling me that?
You mean a man you can control.
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
You're going to attack them?!!!
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Never heard of that system.
A mining colony.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
No hard feelings?
I always said you were a gentleman.
Hyperdrive.
I'm sorry too.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
Thanks.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Are the coordinates set?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
But I feel The Force flowing!
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Believe what?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
We'll see.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Don't lie to me.
Dream on, blue eye.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
I don't know yet.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
No.
It's history. I gotta go.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
No way.
Which way?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
You need help.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
What the hell is this?
Find Cuervo Jones.
I'm looking for somebody.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah.
...I saw nothing.
Move aside!
So be it, to the death.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
It is deep...
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
In the great book.
What's this, what's this?!
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
...to ride out and meet them.
What is it my child?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Your mother told you that?
You freed it, son?
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
We are to blame.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
That I cannot.
Just show the sword.
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
You didn't ask!
To kill and be king, is that all?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
I see, your excellency.
Thank you your excellency.
In here!
Why don't you let me?
Burke.
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Storage.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
What's her name?
Really? wow.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Yes, I think so.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
I beg your pardon?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Like what?
What else?
No.
What?
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Your kidding?
You like it?
Captain Howdy.
He's nice.
Here I'll show you.
Cause I like it.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
You like him.
Do you not like him like daddy?
So what's next?
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
How's the girl?
I'm not Regan.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
Uoy era ohw.
Oh really, when?
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
And also with you.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Only what I read in the papers.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Fuck him!!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Swimming trunks.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Baker.
Teeth.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
How we doing?
Am I late?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Jack...
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Yamaha white.  Nice.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
Come on, stand still.
You recognized me.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Doesn't it matter to you?
Fine.
She's a big girl.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
Yeah.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You could've come.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Shut up, Frank.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
She asked for it.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
This is where the auditions were.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
What's he talking about?
Time for what?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Great.
Yeah.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
What're you talking about?  They love it.
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
Born and bred.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah.
The name's Baker --
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
For a while.  She left.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Nothing personal --
Every year.
Every year.
Like a baby. You?
Hey, business is business.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
Nervous?
Frank wasn't 'there.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Eddie.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
My place.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
So you had a nightmare.
How come?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Not if I kill you first ...
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Get rid of them.
You can't blame me for trying.
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What do you know about it?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Have fun at work.
Great.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Is that tonight?
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
IÂm not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
IÂm sure you do...
WhereÂs my real dad?
Ringing my bell...
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
I donÂt think so.
ItÂs just two kids, right?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for godÂs sake!
She wants to have an affair with me.
Pretty much.
Hey, is that really necessary?
ItÂs your birthday? Today?  WhatÂs your name?  Where were you born?
Yes, thatÂs it...yes, we went to high school together.
I call all you white guys "Jack."
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Me?
You still think this is about me, don't you?
ThatÂs my car!  You stole my car!
Please.  Just tell me whatÂs happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
Look Jack IÂm late.  IÂd love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Thanks.  To you too...
Maybe youÂre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
If youÂre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
HowÂd you do this year, Tony?
What are you talking about?  ItÂs me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
About the plane? What do you think itÂs gonna crash? DonÂt say that...
You mean donÂt go at all? What about my internship?
Party?  Oh no, I canÂt go to a party...
Trust me on this Kate.  I really donÂt think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
ItÂs ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youÂre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We donÂt have time for wining and dining.
ItÂs an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  IÂm gonna buy it...
She got those shoes...
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Surprise.  WeÂre pregnant...  Yeah...that mustÂve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Sorry, Jack.  ItÂs too important to me.
No, open it...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until itÂs light out.
ItÂs wonderful...
Think bigger.
IÂm talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Promise me again...
ItÂs good to see you...
Not with what they pay me...
Jack.
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, IÂll be fine...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Do I know you?
But youÂre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
So we'll get egg nog.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Yes!
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Relax, it's casual.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Victor did.
Is it safe?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Ben!  Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben, are you there?
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
They're not costumes.
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Hilarious.
Sure.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
We need to get past them.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And reverse the mutations --
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
You <u>were</u>?
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Phase Two.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
I'd hold that off awhile.
The Other Side got to him.
Here's the Surgeon.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
No question of her loyalty.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
And take a little trip with them...
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
We must!
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
Now I know...
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
But I did. I'm positive!
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
Nothing -- against all that force.
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
What about Dr. Michaels?
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
Send the following message...
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
Was there any damage?
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Unghh... oh, geez...
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Oh, geez.
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
GOT IT?
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, he's adorable.
Mr. Mohra?
Officer Olson.
And what about the other fella?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Uh-huh.
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man!
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
You bet.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Sir? Right now?
Dad's here.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Know who this is?
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Ah, dammit!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
The heck d'ya mean?
...There's a million dollars here!
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah.
Yah...
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Oh, pretty good.
Just a Diet Coke.
Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
I always liked ya so much...
It's okay, Mike...
So?
Margie Olmstead?
His wife?
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Love ya, Margie.
Uh-huh.
No, no.
Yah.
It's terrific!
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Well -
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Yeah, both of us.
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
I'll expose you.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You can't have the whole brain!
Should we?
So you're staying in tonight?
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Please.
Good.
Here.
Feel anything?
Nothing.
Whatever.
What do you get out of it?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Answer the question!
What... ?
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
Don't ask.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Pardon me?
Tyler Durden.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
There's always that.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
You get the idea.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
My dad.  No question.
Hum.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Any historical figure.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Okay.
Uh... nah...
A liposuction clinic.
Look at your hand.
Look...
I want to know --
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
What about Marla?
Um, well... technically, no.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Paraffin.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Not exactly according to plan.
You need me.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
... no, no, no...
It's the only way to get rid of you...
What?
What?
You told me you'd say that.
You told me you'd say that, too.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
There is no money.
Yes, it is.
You're welcome to join our club.
Pleeeeeease!
How'd you know?
Why?
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
How you doing in there, hero?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
I have to save Eugene!
Taken care of.
We need to hurry.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
I've got to stop and help those people.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
What was the fight about?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Yeah, so what happened?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Clean up?  I don't...
I'm not following you --
Who is this guy, anyway?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I know, honey.  I just --
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I know, we'll be there soon.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Right. April 25th.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Easy, Billy, just open it.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
Why do you think I was hiding?
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
No harm. No foul.
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Huh?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Star Wars?
No.
One hundred.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
No.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
I suppose you have...
I thought he was with you.
Spooks?
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
We just take pictures?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Can you walk?
I could take it or leave it.
Am I out of here?
Those men are all dead.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Well did you or didn't you?
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
Okay.  ... I love you...
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
My agent.  I called my agent.
Thanks.
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Where?  Maybe we can.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
Yes... I... I agree...
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Great place huh?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
But I can't get it... He's...
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
You advise us!
No just Parry.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
You don't have to say that.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Divorced.
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
You can sing the song.
Do you love me, Bobby?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
I don't know.
What?
I don't, huh?
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Who?
I didn't get it, did I?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
That's good.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
What?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
My turn.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Then after that?
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Of course I'd like to.
Yes.
What?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
At game, Carl.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
It's a Borzoi.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Jesus, what a rude person...
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
That's an old maid's tale.
There's some good things on it, though.
Well, she was.
Yes.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Nothin'.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
You look good.
I buy them flowers.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
How old is he?
I'm a good friend of hers.
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
You mean her.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Fletch, this is dumb.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Full name.
My God, you're serious.
What'll it be Fletch?
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Oh, he was dying for years.
There is?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
No idea.
Okay. Some idea.
Gum thought Brazil.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Thank you.
My lawyer was a bum.
You may be right.
Wait a second --
I'd have been long gone.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Oh, about ten days ago.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
No problem.
I know.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Sure, all drifters do.
Where am I going?
They serve dinner on the flight?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
You sure those doors will be open?
Don't say shoot, okay.
Not me.
No problem, boss.
You doing a story on this guy?
Nothing to it.
Cute thing.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
No, thank you.
So were my parents.
Yes.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
How do you know about that?
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
Don't tell me I can't --
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I recommend it.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
What?
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
I'd say charcoal.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Who?
I'll do my best.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Great pipes.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Make eye contact when you say that.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
How much?
You gave it to the girls for one.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
People still watch that?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Twelve pack?
Did he just say what I think he said?
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Fine!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Go on, another time, another place.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Ciao.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
I'm clean.
Everything is everything.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Goodbye.
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sĂŠrenitĂŠ. Elle m'a demandĂŠ de tes nouvelles et si nous ĂŠtions heureux.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Mmm.
Fake it.
He got off on six.
Marseilles.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Strike out, eh?
Morning.  Sometime.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
Yeah.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Third time around.
Darling, may I have this one?
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
You remember Mary Finelli?
Nothing.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Don't know what's behind it.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Wish you weren't.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Uh, huh.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Wait...
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
It did, Pop.  It did.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
What...
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Huh?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Yeah.  That's it.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Uh, huh.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
No.  What house you work?
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I love you, man!
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
You go ahead...
Your bed.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Is that so bad?
What?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
My whole world.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Yes.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Don't say any more.
Alright, alright.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Why?
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Happy Friday the 13th.
Sheriff, you better take this.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
What's it to ya?
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Why?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Yes, but they released me because...
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
Twenty.
It's going.
Not so bad, today.
Okay, I'll call you later.
'Night, Josh.
For a good reason.
Sorry.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Oh my God, Steven.
Yeah...
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
You don't know shit!
-- Bad?!
She did!
Really?
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Ask me in about five minutes.
Hear what?
And you'll never do it again.
Rennie's not coming.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Perfectly.
Nothing.
I packed it. Just for us.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
What are you talking about?
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
You're telling a lie.
Really?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
We changed our minds.
But I didn't get you one...
I'd love to.
Just radio for help, okay???
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Please, hurry...
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I don't want to hear about it.
Asbestos lining.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
Paisley Porter.
She was very evasive.
What are you talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
She's dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
In and out of bed.
That's completely crazy.
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I have a class. I'm late.
Daddy, wait.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
That's always been my problem.
That's very lovely actually.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
Right here. At the door.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
My back is killing me.
Oh yeah?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
What am I doing?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
Washed away.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Why does it matter?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
Engaging.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Someone waiting for you?
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
I haven't come to you.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Are you sure?
Everyone takes his turn.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Going nearer to God!
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
We must end the campaign.
Panditji -- please, help me.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
I hope not.
Hm.  Is it?
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
No.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
That was England.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
It's split the Government.
Very well.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
I like football.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
Something's not right.
What a relief.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
What's wrong with him?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
You know I'm scared of heights.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
They found my eyelash.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Not bad, Jerome.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
German, is that you?
I hope he's not just a body.
Why not?
I was at home.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
What exactly is wrong?
We could go together one day.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
Antonio--
And you got him...
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I bet.
Hi.
I've been doing my homework.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Fatter... some things never change.
No. It's been a long time.
Sure.
Really.
You were asleep.
I see it...
She's on TV.
What do we do?
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
El Paso.
Not now.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
You want to try with me?
You and me.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Where do we go from here?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
What about you?
What about the vault?
Whatever you need.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Just sandwiches...
Not now.
You serious?
How about twenty thousand?
I know.
How?
Nothing. What could I do?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Yes, I do.
Oh, do you?
No, do you really?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
So where are we going, Princess?
Not entirely. No.
No.
No. It's all right.
Thanks.
Why would it?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Where you off to?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Jack Carter.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
The gun he means.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
...they hold on to their money...
I had to.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Eh?
It's not right.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
He is?
I heard that they were running cold.
With River Oaks?
Himself?
You...
That's what I...
They...
What?
How?
What? 
As a robbery.
Have I said that?
What will he pay?
Is that what I said?
What?
Why would they come to me?
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
That's...
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
...what am I going to do all month...
What?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Where was I?
I was at home, where were you?
No, who?
You understand?
Thank you, George.
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Just go to lunch.
Excuse me...
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
...did they...
Levene!
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
Could I...
Get in the goddamn room.
Shelly, you blew the last...
What two?
...do you want to go downtown...?
It isn't me...
Murray said...
The leads are assigned randomly...
Not lately you can't...
Twenty percent.
And fifty bucks a lead.
Now.  Yes...When?
Because I say so.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
It's not impossible.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Well, hadn't it?
That was easy, wasn't it?
Was it?
Uh-huh?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
I'm sorry.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Uh...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Twelve-fifteen.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Gimlet.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Yest...
Tuesday.
I don't know.
We're going to speak to her.
What does that mean?
I...
This.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
You did that?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
The...
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Three.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
To do business.
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
I got surprises for everybody!
Connie.
Because I need MONEY!
No.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
We're making an investment in Havana.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
...Who?
We have time.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I took care of it.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
That plane goes to Miami...
Twenty-five this time.
The room has a bug in it.
Tom, what do I do now?
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Do you gamble?
Very well.
Yes, Michael, it does.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
You would have killed his brother?
Right here.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
The money was sent.
Very impressive.
How is his health?
Let him gamble.
I do not.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
We worked it all out beforehand.
We got no choice.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
How much more a month?
I won't keep you another minute...
What's to be jealous of?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
You liked it too.
The Master is waiting for you.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
Tea is fine.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Why?
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
Well...no, not really --
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
But I didn't do this!
Just that I was in the Marines.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
You don't say?  Which picture?
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
It's new.
No.  I'm fine.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
This David's a friend?
Did you now?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
A very lucky thing indeed.
What happened?
Not at all.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
What won't do?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
What was that?
Oh Clayton.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Fuck off!
Ooooh.
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
I just want to watch it, okay?
Thank you.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Of course.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Yes?
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Go.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
What rumors might those be?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Righto.  Let me see.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
Is there someplace we can talk?
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Who do you think?
I don't want him hurt...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
I knew you'd say that, too --
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
What do you mean -- ?
You know my back -
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Get out of here, then. Now.
I don't think so, Detective ...
You know my back.
Not at all ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Good.
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
Hey, Donny --
How you doing, man?
It's arright ...
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
Remember who my brother is?
You, too, Ma...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Yes, sir -
What do you say, Toby?,
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Yeah --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
I can handle it --
"Shadow games?"
Nah.
I don't know. What -- ?
Sure, man --
No problem -
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
For real?
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
Call 'em here -- ?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Hey -
Very good...
Oh, yeah.
I think so... They're just... So ...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
I take out my slim-jim...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Woo-woo-wooooo!
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
What about The Club ... ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
What's that?
Hello, Otto ...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Excuse me --
Shit all looks the same here --
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No more shines, Billy.
Oh I Him.
Nods.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
What are you gonna do?
How much?
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
Jezuz Christ!
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Paulie was just talking about him.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
He heard.
Yeah, yeah.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Tommy  ...
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
Oh shit.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Gone.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
You don't know that.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
Good, it was all right.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Somethin's in my room.
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Really?
--Half-red, half-black--
I don't know what it's called.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I appreciate that.
Yeah, cured polio.
I did.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
Five.
It's on the college.
I'll be okay.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Not at all.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Who?
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Now wait a minute--
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
There is somebody...
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
How about the ones on that shelf?
285.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
--Well, maybe that means you.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You've never been out of Boston.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
You've never been on a plane.
I don't know.
Haven't called her.
Hence, the word remarried.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Yeah.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
Not to me, they're not.
I didn't want the job.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
I used to go with the wrench.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
So you just want to use me and go?
Okay...
You know, nothing special.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Do you keep in touch with them?
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
If you bring the caramels.
I'm supposed to understand this.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
Fine.
It's important that I learn this.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
At least you have a mother.
No, you don't want to hear that.
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Goodbye.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
How 'bout you?
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Naw. They paroled me.
Joad.
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
An' you say no cops?
You got dances too?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Why, you're the preacher!
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Just around that next bend.
Thought you was in jail.
I aim to.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Want to work, do you?
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
That's where I get off.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Hush!
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Take her with you!
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
No plants.
Sure. We aim to.
I'll walk back.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
Sometimes they do.
I'm ready.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They killed Casy first.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Good-by, Tommy.
There, them stripy ones.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Man bones?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
I'm Martin Blank.
What?
Computer guy.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Really...? So what?
What do you want to do?
Then express yourself, Bob.
Here is now there. There is here.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
Not much else.
I'm a professional killer.
Okay.
Where have I been?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Unbelievable.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Like love?
Yes.
Get the fuck outta here.
You're a government spook?
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
That's probably a good idea.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Up on the right.
No harm no foul.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
I don't think so.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
Never enough.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
Jim?
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Yeah. I guess we did.
You too.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
He sold me this bad boy.
See you in ten years.
To shoot you. Correct.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
All by yourself?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
What's that to miss?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
You sleeping all right in that house?
You too.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
It is. It's lovely.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
What?!
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Okay.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Mom?
Maybe they should put me down too.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Little.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Why? There's no food in the house?
I'll take care of it.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
My period.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Tom's gone.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
So do you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
No, let me go.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
Take your time.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Oh, how sweet.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
No thanks.
Yeah.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
You're catching on.
I don't know if I can.
Sure.
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
You just showing off for her!
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Alright sir.
Hack the Planet!
That's far out!
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Cereal.
Dead?
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Revenge.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Razor and Blade.
Okay. Let's go shopping.
Yeah?
If I win, you become my slave.
I know, I know who wrote it.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Yeah.
I think we've got something.
What's happening?
Cancer?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
So?
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Real charmer.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
We've been better.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
What does that mean?
No. You son of a bitch!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Its too late.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a sister?
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Oh Rachel!
No.
Hi Jamie.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
He's here, Sheriff.
He's been here.
Least I'm not alone.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Car trouble?
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
He shouts, too.
We just talked.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I have a place for that.
Why did you hang up on me?
He can still watch.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Will you call me tomorrow?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Sure.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
After the movie.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
There is no such thing.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
I'm scared...
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
No! Do as I say.
Let's make more popcorn.
You're coming with us...
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Oh.
You want to see some?
Uh --
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
No, he called late last night.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Right.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I'm an architect.
And it ruins everything else.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
Ed Smythe, yes.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Oh, right.
Oh, don't say those words!
Not because of me, I hope.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Mom, come out!
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
No.
Jesus...Jesus!
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
How are you?
Oh...
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Yeah.
Football!
Wow!
Is there no chance?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
He's not a loser at all!
Well, how about this?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Well, I just came from an audition...
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
No!
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Yeah.  Me, too.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
No, well...I've been trying to write.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
I am.  You-you made my day.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, who cares?
Oh, yeah?  What?
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Yeah.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Mmm, what?
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Hmm.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
They're offering... 
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...would you excuse me...?
Yeah, so where is he?
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
Not with any certainty we...
...are you alright, sir...?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Have the child taken to bed.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Try Barney Clark.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Let the girl go.
...what's he got against you?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
I think its meaning is clear.
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
I'll have them picked up.
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I have had the honor. 
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
...yes, yes, yes...
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
You're <u>free</u>...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
You goin to shoot yourself? 
...and that is what you need to expand.
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
Brazilian. 
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
...would you use a small word?
What is your point?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
Because?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
I hope so...
What are you gonna do about it?
You guys have been so colossal...
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
I just never thought of you in that...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Talking while kissing.
Don't worry, you...
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week. My mom says it's okay that I stay overnight at your dorm...It'll be nice to see you in                          ] a different shirt.                                          ] ] WICHITA                                            ] Oh, I didn't tell you.

What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Don't get cocky, girl.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
It's not my style, okay?
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
You're beautiful.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
All right.
Because you're an idiot.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
Sure.
I didn't. Cherry.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Like a suicide thing?
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Next channel, darling.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You didn't say Simon Says.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Let's kick his ass.
Punch it in!
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
What's that?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
playfully shoves his hand away.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Come on through.
frowns at Henry.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I'm not hungry.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
Open this door!
stands and walks toward the door.
gives her a sympathetic look.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
You're such an incredible woman.
That idiot boarder?
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
That was what we were led to believe . . .
All right, then.
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
All finished.
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Just get better okay?
What?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Ambrose. I know.
What's the difference?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
What?
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
Really, why's that?
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Ambulance.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Well now there's a compliment.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You mean John Bubber?
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Lie, you mean...
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
That's not what I mean...
John, I know all about it.
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Never reach out!
You didn't?
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
He's pretty... remarkable.
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Let's watch some TV.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
I understand that.
No, no, no, no.
That would be stupid.
Sure.
It's a living.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Bye, Neil!
I'm thirsty.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
That's okay, Mom.
What?
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Damn.
What?
What?
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
All new houses have noises.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Oh, honey.
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
I'm having the floor fixed,
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Put it out, man!
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
What about cable?
I didn't.
Get on the other side of that.
Talk to me about what?
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
That is what bothers me.
For what?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
How long is the voyage?
Living.  Remember?
She's the King's cousin.
No.  What am I to do?
No -- I will.
How?
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
What do you want?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
Because it's my name.
I don't know anymore.
Jennifer.
About what?
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
I know.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
--for three hundred years.
And the other one -- he is like you?
Get out.
What's that next to him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
And this?
I know, Paul.
I like my work.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
I can take care of myself.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
It's not for me to decide.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I can take care of myself.
I think he's dead!
Yes, sir.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
The best.
It's happening right now.
I'm going to my desk.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
How about the cop?
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Use more ice.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
I got the gasoline --
They'll cut the power.
I overheard him with the girl.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
Okey-doke.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
What hospital?
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
I know.
We can't make the microwave work.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
How about dog shit?
Mars?  What are you doing?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Go, Chief.
I know the one.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Go, Mickey.
Yes, sir.
Not until the man calls.
In my room.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Can you get into the office?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
They're still in the house.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Of course.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Where is your family?
I don't have that much.
And four children?
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
What's happening?
Canadian Club?
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
And what will they do with these satellites?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
How so.
Business is good at the hotel?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Why not? We are half way there already.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
I saw the sign.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Call, sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
He will be here.
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I will see what I can do.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
Please, be quiet.
I couldn't help.
Murdered! By whom?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Where are you hurt, son?
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
A kiss.
Yes.
Why?
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
We are almost out of everything.
Please do not talk like this.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Why?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Many times.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
The lieutenant wants the register.
When?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
So what stopped her?
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Yeah...something.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
Nothing.
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Up here --
And we get this money when?
Prove it.
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Most fun I've had all day.
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
He's gotta still be down here.
I don't do groups.
So where's the party?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
What?
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
I can't remember at the moment.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Good way to get your head blown off.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
The lockdown thing.
What's going on?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
He would have been back by now.
-- ten.
Over here.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
What's the matter?
What was her name?
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
Suppose not.
Ok...
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
My God, I heard something!
He's blessing the house.
For good luck honey.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
To our family.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I think everything's ready.
What's happening!
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Yes, I am.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
What!
How can I help you?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
Runic?
Well what is it!
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
What happened to him?
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Right.  Right!
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
Taken what?
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Can we see?
You're JP Monroe, right?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
A prize?  For what?
Wow.  Thank you.
Unh-unh.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
Fuck you!
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
I laughed, I cried.
Gum.
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
Yeah.  The big E.
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
God go with you, sister.
That's what you theenk.
Never, why do you ask?
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
This is too bad to be false.
Trust Leonardo....
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
I guess that's a no.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Alchemy.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
With a little jazz.
The Hudsucker Hoop!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Yeah.
He didn't offer you money.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Aim --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
I don't know...
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Says who?!
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Huh?! But, buddy --
But, buddy --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Say, that was a swell idea!
Norville.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
Wait a minute!
Oh my God, sir!
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Old Faithful.
He notices.
She is!
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
That's nonsense, Alma.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
It'll wait.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Of course not!
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Good morning.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
To the asylum?
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
And as usual no one believed me...
Good night.
So early?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
You go dry off now.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
We're not going anywhere.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Good.
Fine.
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Good night kiddo.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
It was lovely!
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Yeah. You?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
With Mikey?
We were just riding around.
They say you never forget.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
I gotta get to English class.
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
The Idiot?
Great, thanks for the tip.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Sure.  Twinkie?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Wendy!
Huh?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
What time is it?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
One more shot?
That's all, for now.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
Too bad...
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Where is he?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What I saw?
Has her books in it.
First I need a copy of the key.
What?
That's right.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
You know I remember that.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Best friend?
Long as it's fun.
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
What was?
Yes.
There's nothing more to talk about.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Nothing if not vampires...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
You let them do it.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
No. Laudanum.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Claudia - don't -
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Not yet.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
So you felt it too!
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Why should I be?
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Dying?
The crucifix -
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
I don't pretend to know.
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
How could I not? She had to know.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
It's over, I'm telling you...
What about a radio?
What the hell would you call this?
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What are you doing in my closet?
Yet. Nothing yet.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Karla! You promised.
Some.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Can't what?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
It's...him.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Hello?
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
How much?
The rest of us see bathrobes.
How's the water?
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
This was once a cemetery.
They were gore before I came here.
All the graves?
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Poor Cathy --
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
I was looking for you.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
It was, the plague
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ÂÂyoung handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you Â- I'll warn them against you.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Why -- no not before Thea came ÂÂ
This girl -- Thea Â- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
Hero?
I can't understand that.
We have no time for that.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
But the war, the army ÂÂ they need you.
Listen to what I say --
Come Â- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
It is for that he hates me.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it Â- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Made what?
No, of course not.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Where is she?
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star ÂÂ made second team All American.
Yes, but George . . .
Hiya, George!
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
When'd you see him last?
I know ÂÂ I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Hee-haw!
All in . . .
Oh ÂÂ Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Hmmm?
No.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Oh, George!
No.
Yes ÂÂ charge.
Okay.  What's yours?
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Huh?
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
I'd like to do that.
Neither am I.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Left them at the office.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Just a teensie one ÂÂ ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I've eaten.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
You going to the lighthouse?
What the hell.  For you....
I think we're changing course a little.
Swim for it!
They're moving pretty fast.
Yeah.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
No!  It's still there!
It's still there!
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Got it.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Me neither.
Too late, it's written.
Is that what it is?
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
We don't know that, do we?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Careful.  What's wrong?
Terrific.
What'd I say?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Now I really want to see it.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
I will, I will.
Great.
Nope.
Nope.
Double nope!
Anything?
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
No.
I can go out if I want to.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Eat Cheerios.
Quiet!  Shhh!
He thought he had a good reason.
So?  So?
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
They just wanted to say hello.
Nothing.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
I talked you into this?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Yes.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No, you're not.
Sounds wonderful.
What's up?
Sure.  Let's go.
... Mean through the tubes?
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
No!
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
So do I, love.
We're taking that shark alive!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Not good enough.
How you doing, Kelly?
... Massachussettans aren't.
I don't know, it depends.
Are you really?
Why you sonuvabitch...
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
I don't know, what else is there?
No, think of something else.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Now what's this do?
He's diving!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Now what?
It's disappeared.
Calvin said it was all right.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Polar bears in Georgia???
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
So was Dad.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
But you always let me....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
He told me you both did....
We forgot to stop at the store.
Then don't come any closer.
You caught me....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
What difference does it make?  It's here....
I'm not doing anything.
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
It's too dangerous....
You guys must be starving....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
I am.
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
No.
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Where do I pull off...?
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
I have my own little island.
You sure you know how to do this.
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
We'll be done pretty soon....
You didn't stick them on right....
They put bombs on dolphins....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Stop busting my hump....
What?
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
When we got the grant....
So far..
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
You don't like my voice...?
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
It'll work....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
"Welcome to Eureka."
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
I think you're here all day.
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
So am I. But where's my money?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
You don't really believe this?
You ain't going in alone?
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
No.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
Wrong cabinet.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
I've heard you call him Freddy.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
My hands?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
Yes.
Of course I would ..
It was probably the wind.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
Do you pray?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Have you known her long?
How d'you know what I'm like?
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
I'm blind because my father drank.
The man from the F.B.I.
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Whass going on here?
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Ask him.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
One of the accountants.
Ugh!
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Look, I don't want a --
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
No.
Listen to me, it's over.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Bill, Rod, wait --
Oh, tell the story.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Thanks.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Oh good.
What?
Tell me -- let me help --
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
I'll give it everything.
Yes.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Very much.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
No.
I understand your anxiety.
That's your word?
Great word.  Towel?
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
How do I know?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Go.  Flee.
What --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Not a chance.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
I'm not your brother!
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Nothing.
We have to help him.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, itÂs was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
When did you have it last?
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
You couldn't have made that jump.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
How low?
Just hold on.
I thought you were an expert.
It won't hold!
We'll be broke in four weeks.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
KEEP GOING!
The last of my breed.
Goodbye, Alan.
A well-accepted theory.
Any weapons, radios?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
Then we go home?
No. I couldn't see.
No we're not.
This plane can not land!
I have never been on this island!
It certainly does.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
Everyone, keep your voices down!
I want to see the nesting ground!
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I don't even know this woman.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
What?  Why?
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Isn't it obvious?
The velociraptors.
Piss.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Oh, God.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You're going too?
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
No way.
What's that?
Why should they?
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Funded by whom?
Are you insane?!
Oh, no!
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Oh my God.
Why?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They smell.
What kind of park is it?
The - - agility.  You're right!
Say again?
We're out of a job.
I know.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - barfs them up - -
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
No, no, no!
Okay.
And scary.
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
- - shut up.
Hola, bienvenido
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
In a box under my seat.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Thank you.
Tim, are you okay?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
"Thunder lizard!"
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Nope.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Try to!
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
The kids okay?
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
I'll stay awake.
All night.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
John, John.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Sure.
That was great!
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
He... he's here...
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Fuck you.
What?
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
So?
None of that's true?
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Insomnolesence...
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
That's open to debate.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Yeah, what is it?
So what do we do?
Not yet.
Great.	When can you do it?
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
How's that possible?
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
What is it really?
Yes -- we do.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
A man must eat --  And drink.
In a manner of speaking.
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Then its authority is in doubt.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
You're just doing your job.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
I do.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
What of it?
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
... A piece of paper ...
Orlac is an account?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
Oskar.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
It's ... lovely.
Value? ... Value?
Jack!...  Jack!
An ape ... some kind of ape.
What?
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
I'd just be guessing.
You think people hate you.
Didn't want you.
No.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
No, that's not --
Like for you to look for the man.
-- Yes.
Yes.
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
My name's John Klute.
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Most of them.
OK.
-- OK?
No thanks.
What do you think?
Is that what you gave him?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You said you wanted these.
I don't see anything, do you?
Try some other ways. 
No, I said what did you think.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Mm.
How?
I don't get you.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
My bed.
Mm.
Yup.
Right back at the start, right?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
About what?
Can you use these?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
How is it back there?
Well as a matter of --
Yeah.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Just send me a money order.
It's not so bad.
Goodbye, Pete.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
He's in his room, playing.
Detroit.
Welcome to the... 
Soon.  Very soon.
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
In a minute...
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
That's okay...
I'm allergic to onions.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Yeah?
Uh huh?
You mean for good?
Sure.
It's my name too.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Why does he decide?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Yes, your honor.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
No.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
So do you.
Such as?
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, do you love him?
Joanna, what the hell is--
What?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
I don't know, Jim...
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Sure.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
Fine.
Six.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Look, Ted, all I--
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Got it.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
No!
Are you, General?
I have.
We did not.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
We do not know.
What do you think?
I am him.
No. Not very big.
No. This war is almost over.
Look here!
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
I had relinquished doubt.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
I leave tomorrow.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
You cannot.
The Chinese.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
No, Holiness.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Thank you.
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
What the hell are you doing?!!
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
It came from across the lake.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
So profound and fat.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
Right.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Thank you, Jack.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
Are you sure?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
Could we have intercourse?
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
I'd be able to see something.
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Okay.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Good thinking.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
I can look at dead things.
You talk to the married couple?
What kind of backup do we have?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
I got nothing against--
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
You threw it at me!!
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Yes.
Kevin, hey.
Me too.
The somebody else part?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
Kevin told me you were upset.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Why does she keep repeating the name?
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Get me out!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Okay, Mr. Yow...
That wasn't me.
Thanks.
Not yet.
Yes sir.
And what is that, sir?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
But if he knew we have so little time -
Let's get some coffee and talk.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Did you ever work with her?
May I see your credentials?
Yes.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
All flayed...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Mmm. And what else...?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
How long did you live there?
Why so briefly?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
All right, then tell me how -
Later, listen, I'll -
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
I'm sorry.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
He delivered no such message.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
: Only one or two loads.
You're not coming with us?
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
That's all, sir.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Granted.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Be my guest.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What has?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
No.
No!
Fuck your orders!
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Good...It's going good.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Where's Jones?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Roger.
Ahhhh!
I know that.
Beautiful.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Under there?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
Like a leech.
Let's hope it holds.
I ought to smack your face!
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Oh man, that's just great...
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
It's a Samoan pub.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
You get the guns?
They were . . .
Fucking Northern monkeys.
No Harry, you can't.
It looks like Ă­t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
That's no way to answer the phone.
Sure is.
All right, Kenny.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
No.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
OK, open the gate.
What the fuck is going on?
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Hit the fuckers.
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
What do you mean?
Why, what's up?
Right as rain.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Nick the Greek.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
What do you mean?
So?
You think I can't learn that?
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I'm sorry, sir.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
We were just dancing--
I'm feeling okay--
You're testing me?
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
You little pissant--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
He never asked her.
The Trail of Tears.
So they stayed in Florida?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Cool.
You own this place?
Lead mine.
It's a lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Maybe.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
You could take it--
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
That's where he fell.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
And people make their choice--
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Bandidos, Injuns--
Protection?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
--Santiago.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Right.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Buddy Deeds--
And the ten thousand?
The Perdido thing?
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
A little older than Paloma is now.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
I never said that.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
He's going to wish he was dead.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
That was the night he disappeared?
And when my father was Sheriff?
Enough with the clothes--
I only went for my last two years.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
So she tells me three times a week.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
You've got your mother, your kids--
More, I hope.
Two years.
I've felt that way, yeah.
Pilar--
What was your father's name?
Couple months before I was born--
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
I'm going over to the other side.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You don't need to cuff me.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Sure.
No--
Uh-huh.
You going to tell him?
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Nix?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Nope.
A Nix specialty?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
Right.
Why would I do that?
What about death?
So tell me where Nix is buried.
You'll do more.than that.
Why did you wait so long?
What is he?
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Does that mean...?
Sure.
They won't tell you anything.
That's my business. Harry.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
It was more than that, I think.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
No.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
It's okay.
Harry-?
Somebody killed him.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Mine.
Probably.
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
It's me betrayed him.
Will that do?  No?
Is that all?
And you're not?
No.
Yes.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
What?
No.
Who's not?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Bob, it's me.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Oh.
Ok.
Hi, Charlie.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, I was looking at you.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
Oh, she'll love it.
Fuck off.
We should get you to the doctor.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
That's what you said the other night.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Thanks.
I don't think so.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Good-night.
Bob?
Is this a bad time?
It's Lydia, your wife.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I got some hair stuff.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
It'll just be a few days.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
When did they find her?
I can't believe Will killed him.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
What time did you make it for?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
You heard voices, you know you did.
I hope so.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You ready?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
Kelson, hold on a second...
How many weeks are you honey/
Peter Kelson?
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
I'm going to look around.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
What did he say to you in French?
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
He's looking right at me.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Nothing.  So good luck.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
I don't remember that.
That's ridiculous.
Camille, she'll be fine.
The blue.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
Shh.  It's okay.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
It's okay.
Why not?
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
No.
Mom tell you to do this?
He's in college?
Too many times.
You lost your head.
Chances are there's still a chance.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I was just playing ball.
Didn't have to try very hard.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
I wouldn't know.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
Oh.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Your legs don't look broke.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Who's Spalding?
You either.
He ain't Spalding.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
That what you think?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Plan to.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
The "man" again.
Are you out of your mind?
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
We won the championship.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
No.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
What?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
What's that, not great?
I've been hearing you.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Okay...
What?
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
Your door was unlocked.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
ooohhhhhh no.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Brain and Lung.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
baby, please, please --
I'm coming!
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
You don't have a boyfriend?
You just move in here?
-- do you wanna cup?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
No, no.
Let's make a deal.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
What?
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
You don't know how crazy I am.
Yes.
Diet Coke.
I want a shot of tequila too.
It doesn't matter.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Cynthia?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
I was listening --
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
You do?
I'm trying.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Who?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
It's ok.
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Is this 509-9027?
Alright.  Thank you.
You got us a room so quick?
Like I said, yeah --
Let's talk about --
-- let's talk more about your background --
And that's what you've heard?
Around here.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
people die.
Not a problem.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Oh yeah.
yeah.
Calm down.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
What's this, how did this happen?
I went out last night.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I got in trouble at school.
I need you to get me Paula --
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I'm drinking.
I'm a bad person.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
Yeah.
Rose, I don't --
How long with Ellen?
What about now?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Do you have any children with anyone?
...I don't know...
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
That's pretty cool.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Should be one-thirty.
See you.
I didn't know the answer --
Stand up.
It's ok.
It's ok.
....Why does he do it...?
It's not right.
I have money.
This happens....this is something that happens.
That is good.
No, stay back!  Stay back!
I wish to discuss your brother.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
Soon enough.  Here we are.
A body.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
I have it all worked out.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
But -- what is he doing?
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
I know.  God go with you.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
There are more important things than tits.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Come on...
He is right, d'Artagnan.
Who does?
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Athos, my friend!
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
The King killed my son!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
I decided it this morning.
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
It shall be done, your Majesty.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
There.
Yes, yes, go on.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Raoul... is in love...
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
What do you need?
Where are you?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I didn't hit shit!
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Did you start out area six?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
No -
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.
What else is new?
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Hop in.
Screw him!
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
What's the bottom line?
Book code?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
I am all right.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
To recover the mind set.
The mark? Yes.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
There's no connection between the families.
What?
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
What?
How far away's the back-up?
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Uh-huh.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Francis? Where are you?
Yes...
Yes.
Oh, God.
Please, no.
God, no.
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why do you think I called?
What about the dog?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I love you...
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
...after a while.
Huh?
I got it. Thank you.
Stuart is fine.
No.
You read about it, I'm sure.
Yes.
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Those are my terms.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Hi George!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
There'll be other shots.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Yeah...
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
No thanks.
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
If you want...
I can shtop whenever I want...
You don't know the real me.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Then your father's a wimp.
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
What's your name?
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
Know what?
Hurry!
And you are?
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
No!
Any time.
Go.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
You could say that.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
What does that mean?
Far from it.
How?
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
That I would find the One.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Good.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Shit, I'm sorry.
Who are you?
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
What is the Matrix?
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
It's going into replication.
That's different.
We can't leave him!
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
I don't know.  It just went dead.
There has to be something that we can do.
I'm going in after him.
Yeah?
Do what?
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
What are you talking about?
He's alive.
What the hell just happened?
That means it's good.
Why?
Be careful.
No.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Not quite...but keep trying.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Should I slap him?
No, she isn't.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
Mind your own business.
What pipes?
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
OK, get in.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Yeah, where's the rest?
I know.
Hostess?
Chinese food?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
What did he do?
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Here.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
What is it now?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
A paper on that one too?
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Count it.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
This is some boat.  Your father's?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
You think so?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Hi, Allison --
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
That you've been to Susan?
He said he would be there with bells on.
But what?
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Both.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
I thought you were buying my company.
Right away.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Then why did you bring it up?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
'Yes' to the deal?
Did you just hear something?
Me, too.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
What?!
What do you mean?
I am now.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
As much as Joe's?
For how long?  And why?
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Joe, you do get around.
Thanks, Quince.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah.  Neat.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
'It's up to Joe'?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Yes?
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Love.
No.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
Yes?
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
And I appreciate you, too.
To bed.
Yes.  I'm tired.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
-- I guess you haven't.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Don't.  That will come later.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Good night to you, Bill.
Yes?
What do you mean?
I guess so.
Yes, Bill.
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
Yes.
It's all yours.
This universe?
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Not at all.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
And we're very grateful.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Speak up, please.
What?
What you were talking about.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Yes, Bill.  The question.
How's that, Quince?
You think Drew will go for it?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
How did you know?
Does Drew tell you everything?
Uh oh --
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Yer damn right.
We've met.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
I don't know.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
That's why it's okay.
Oh, yes --
I agree --
I could be her.
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
Why?
Hi, Leonard.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Don't say anything else.
Take the money and walk away!
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
And what did he say?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
Calls himself Dodd.
Don't protect him.
Help me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Can I ask you something?
What do you want?
What are you here for?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
You're in a playful mood.
I'll be waiting.							   *
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Probably left it in your room.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
Shut it, Teddy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Sammy didn't have a wife.
Are you sure?
Somehow, I'll know!
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
You can't just take it!
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
Doing...?
What's your twenty?
"And" what?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Good.
JosĂŠ Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Tell them what you want.
Two main players plus three.
25% discount on the load.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
You do.
She's dead...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
Later!  Do you dance?
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Do I need it?
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Of course.
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
Alonzo...
Something's wrong.
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
Who knows...
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
We're makin' moves on each other.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Then you should.
Okay.  What's up?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
He did volunteer one time...
JosĂŠ doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
What would you do...?
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
You set this up!
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
They lied.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
For what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
Walk? Naturally I can walk.
What of?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
They gotta be.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Gonna be like money from home.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
You want to split your hernia again?
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
I know.
Sure.
Not far. Just a little way.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Stupid.
But didn't have heroin.
But just...
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
...She was on the plane.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
Twelve years.
Section 13?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
You know where it is?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
New York's finest.
What?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Oh, man, there you go again.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
The kid's with them!!
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
I pull.
Nino, please...
Manny...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
No, there's...
No such thing, baby.
Toss the flare down!
Peter-
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Jump in.
Peter...
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
Anything you can tell me might help.
Sure.
Will I be able to walk?
Following me?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
I guess that means it's okay.
I can live with "great."
My pleasure.
I DIDN'T...
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
I want my pills NOW!
--cliff-hangers--
A toast?
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
You really think so?
It's perfect.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Be my guest.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
What? What is it?
Just from his agent.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What is it?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
So do I...
I'm sure you're right.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
From her point of view or mine?
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Hugh, I'm impressed..
I suppose I did.
Well, that's good, isn't?
To do what?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
And you're happy about that?
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
More like two-two point two million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Not for seven more minutes.
How much longer before you can reach him?
What if I pay the rent?
- torque wrench.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Ethan Hunt.
So do I.  Sort of.
Damn, you're beautiful.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Then feel better!..
Yes?
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
Ethan, tell me -
How do you suggest I go about it?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Twice.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Nyah still on the property?
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
By asking me.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Don't move.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
What happened to Jim?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is "they?"
Who is they, who is they?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I'm going to answer it.
Sure...
What about you?
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
ItĂ­s all right, Ethan..youĂ­ll bring me back...wonĂ­t you...
Yeah.  I follow you.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
My contact is extremely shy.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Higher.
Jim we canĂ­t.
Why?
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
I remember..
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking IĂ­m dead and gone.  God knows what sheĂ­s had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
But, he didnĂ­t know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy NeighbourĂ­s wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldĂ­s lovers, heĂ­s tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Jack...that's spying.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
ItĂ­s not working.
No, I'm going.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
I won't come.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Maybe.
Hurry up.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
He's in Palermo.
Loretta.
Just Johnny.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You think so?
No!
Because I have no Luck!
Me neither.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
That light.
Don't just become excited.
I'll come to the wedding.
But he wants me to come!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Why?
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Johnny.
She was too young for him.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Yes?
What do you mean?
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
How about a month from today?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
I must ask for that back.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
No more he's not.
Oh.
You gotta date?
That's a pretty big sin.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
I came right from the airport.
Where is she?
That's incredible.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
I don't know.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Absolutely!
None of your business.
I'm a housewife.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
No.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Good night.
What? What?
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
NI!   NI!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
And not too expensive.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
So be it!
Had enough?
Course I have.
Had enough ... ?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
My liege,  I am honored.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
Just keep me covered.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
I am an enchanter.
A G...g...g...
It is the rabbit.
I'm thirty-seven.
Shut up!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Shut up!
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
I'm getting better!
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
I was saved at the last minute.
... and you'll come and get him.
Got it?
No, not anyone else - just me.
What is your name, handsome knight?
No, It's nothing!
Oh ... hello ...
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
No, I'm not.
We must examine you.
You got my note!
He's come to rescue me, father.
Don't say that word.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Not down south you don't.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
I'm getting dressed.
It's a diary.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
I hope to go up next year.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
A situation?
I'm flattered you think so.
Quite.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
My own.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Quite.
It's nothing.
This is the top.
No love.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
What does he know about the Highlands?
That doesn't make him an expert.
I do not accept.
I'm breaking no promises!
The question is, do we need her?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Dear oh dear.
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
I understand he was in a fight.
What is it?
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
How'd you know it was us?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Yeah...
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
It's twelve-thirty!
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
What?
You didn't hear me?
Got it.
Right, then...
Oh God...oh god...
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
The Cowboy??
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Whatever.
Okay, I'm thinking.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
You got it! See you later honey.
Right. See ya.
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
But you won't.
May I have your name please?
But it said #12.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
But, this could be serious.
What do you mean?
You don't remember anything else?
Mulholland Drive?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
I'm all right.
Good luck!
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
I just wanted to come here.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
Where's the dock ?
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
I'm leaving.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
I'm not listening.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
Excuse me ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
Okay.
Let's go.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
I work here, remember ?
Hey , Hey !
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
A dragon.
That's cute asshole.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
Got it.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
I am thirty two.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
What do you mean sir ?
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
I'm listening.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
I don't know.....
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
What happened ?
Thank you.
Yes.
Sure.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Yahoo !!!!!
We just having our first date when you showed up.
Shut up ! It's me.
I'm fine.
We made it !
Who was that guy anyway ?
Good morning.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Oh, just put it over there.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Well you know what I mean.
Great.
What boy likes you?
Her favorite poet.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
What??
Totally groovy huh?
I love you too sweetie, bye.
She just had a baby that's all.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
How about a nice glass of milk?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
I'd like to, thanks.
Does she?
You are?
I've got something better.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
Well...
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
He likes you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Give it back Nicholas!
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
I want juice!
Yeah, RIGHT.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
What difference does it make?
I'd never do that.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
And I thought I was weird.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Give it to me!
Leave me alone!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.

I'd consider it a personal favor.
Ten bucks.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Sounds like you're very organized.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
I'll be here.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Oh, sure okay.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
O.K.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Vada!!
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
What?
I'm impressed.
Yeah, all right...
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
What Hurts Vada?
I think it's still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Pardon?
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Okay.
Oh, how do you mean?
It's nice.
Here?
In ages, I know, me neither.
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Goodnight.
Is it really your camper?
You can get the general idea...
Pointing upwards Look...
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Any more soda left?
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Can I go too?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Hi.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
Oh, Vada...
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
He likes her.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Oh.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Thomas?
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Aarrggh.
Uh huh, why?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Oh great!!
I'm eleven and a half.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
I'm allergic to it.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
I'm trying.
Yes.
It's my mother.
Go???
What?
So?
For their meat.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
He likes her better than me.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Like they do on TV?
But, I don't know how.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Something like that.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
He's still in love with you.
I have a suggestion...
No, he's ruining yours.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
Someday she'll thank you.
That was Thursday.
What do you suggest?
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
You need a few dollars.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
... whatever is manly and independent.
He won't get mad, huh?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Don't you see...
I love him.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I know Ben.
It doesn't say th...
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
Such as.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
I got the point.
Never can tell.
It's more than that.
The night we met.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
It means a lot.
... maybe it's congratulations.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
And your point?
She admits it's her fault.
Shhh.
This is where I proposed.
That is so romantic.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
That's little egotistical.
If you find her...
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Right here.
What do you have to buy?
I won first prize.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
You're so good.
How did you come in here?
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Green.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Okay. Thanks.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
He knows better.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Third party?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
President.
How come?
National?
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
She's in Paris.
I'll just be in here.
Your brother?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
A little. What do you need?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
Well, he's really amazing.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
No.
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
No.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Nash.
Bet the sheets are grey.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Bye.
When I was little, in church.
About three years.
Linnea?
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
I can't.
Oh.
I'm not sure...
How much?
Might be good for you.
What!
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Mary?
Hello.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
He ain't really new.
You serious?
I see.
Yes you are.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
Yes, they were.
Yes, you are.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
I can appreciate that.
What?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
She was born without a tongue.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Aside from the obvious?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Says who?
Okay, let's cut it.
Yeah, we have a van.
On average forty million.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Yes.
No. Not really.
No fuckin' way!
Unfortunately, yes.
And a snake-eye glare.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Survival of the fittest.
Just for fun, I guess.
They actually apologized.
Where do the air ducts lead?
It's hard to say Capt'n.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Wayne Gayle.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Slate it.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Out.
You in a big hurry, boy?
All right, you get out of here, man!
What d'you think?
Where was that?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
I been sendin' her money.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Okay.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Yeah. On the section gang.
Went to college, huh?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
No.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
What is it?
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Are you married?
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
Okay, I guess.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Come here, baby.
You still didn't answer my question.
You jivin' me?
What about your boy?
They won't.
Yeah!
Watch out!
There's nothing to say.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
'Round town.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
What 'you signifyin'?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Okay.
'Don't sound so sure.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
Great.
She don't look no worse to me.
Sure.
How are you?
I doubt it.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
It's for your own good.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
I understand.
Hi.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
I ain't drunk, honey.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
No. I only needed the code from you.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
How's the villa's security?
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
No, but it traced me.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
I find out now.
Are you even really alive?
It's Case. Remember me?
All things possible in Babylon.
Nobody has.
We run. You crack the pattern?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
Case.
I think you're full of shit.
What's my end?
What?
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
You're out of time, man.
Oh I know.
Petty good.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Â uhh, must have forgotten-
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
YOU KNIT?
Leave.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexyÂ  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Hidden camera.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Oh. Right.
Have you been to any parties?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Yes, desperately.
Better than I...
And a gymnast!
Sorry. Forgetful.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Thank you.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Don't look down!
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I know.
When are you going to open your eyes?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, I have.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Lock.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
And heavy...
No.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
It's getting there.
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
It was okay.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Yeah?
Wow...
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Whoa!
Oh, Jesse...
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
There's nothing to figure out.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Hi, Kerry.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Okay...thanks.
That's right.  I don't.
They're healing up nicely.
Don't hold your breath.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
He's close...
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
Do you still...see each other?
I -- I think so!
I think so.
What?
I don't do that shit.
Those are ancient history.
Thank you.
It's been a long time.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Call me Nancy.
Never been here before?
Sorry.
Sounds like a rough time.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Remember -- open mind.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Your dreams?
What?
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Where...here?
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
I'm not listening.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
Films mainly.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Hi.
And what happens next in the dream?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
I thought you were leaving.
What did you say?
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
You've got to go.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Well done you.
Well, get a message through to him too.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
What?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Who was Gilda?
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
And this is William.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
... get fired.
Yes -- sort of...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
The others?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
So it could have been neither of them?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Definitely no comment.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
What are the choices?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
And you get on very well.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Fabulous.
So?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Would you like to start?
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Who? Tell me!
Will you come with me, please.
Yes, ma'am.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
What for?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
B-B-Billy.
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
Go ahead! Go back!
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
M-M-M-Mack?
What for?
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Shhh...
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Me, too...
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Lobotomy?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I don't trust you!
Sure, Mack...
What's this?
What is it?
Good. Good.
Time out!
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Because I quit breathing.
Martini out!
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
No...
I don't have any.
I'm sure you will.
After you, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am,
Bet you ass...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
What's that?
That!
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Of course not.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
--separate, in the evening..."
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Oh no.  Do you?
Dwayne?
Okaaaaayyyy.
No.
But, Faith--
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
I'm in love with you.
NO.
Yes.
Does he love you?
You didn't answer my question.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Because.  I know where he is.
You too.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Are you asking me out?
What?
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Oh, hello.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
So?...
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Yes you did.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
I think he's having an affair.
No...  I can just tell.
But it's July.
Does Dwayne know about this?
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
'Course he does.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Oh my God.  Where?
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
...and a fortune teller.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
What?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Oh.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
No.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
You used to love it when I called you doll.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
She didn't give me a chance.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
I'm not thirsty.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Then don't.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Nolan? I knew he had guts butÂ
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Boss loader!
I know. I know.
Don't say that!
I could have been better!
I wish I knew, Edie, ButÂ 
Hello, Edie.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Everybody knew him. He got around.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
I don't know.
The things that go on.
In a saloon?
I am?
How do you like it?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? ButÂ I didn't stay in shapeÂ andÂ  ÂI had to take a few dives.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killedÂnever mind how. Charley and I was put in a placeÂthey called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers andÂ  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm notÂ I'm justÂ all mixed up... .
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurtÂ What more do you want?
You?
What I did to Joey.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Get out of my way.
Well, it's over.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Terry...?
You are likeÂ
Let me by.
A question of who rides who.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothersÂ and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was youÂ  Â Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
You go toÂ
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to CharleyÂ and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroomÂ with the truth as you know itÂ  Truth is the gunÂ Drop that thing and tell the truthÂ a more dangerous weapon than this little Â  Âcap pistol.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Baseball batsÂ that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Take it easy.
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'Â
You'd be off the pier for good.
I told you lay off.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
YeahÂ us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
No.
Easy. Easy, boy.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Thirty-sixÂ sevÂ aah I lost the count.
By way of Chicago?
How'd you get that.
I can't believe itÂ a small fortune.   You can't buy meÂ you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
One of these days.
What are you down here forÂ to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
I do not joke in my proposal.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Be careful!
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
Of course I do.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
It would seem so, Master
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Ahh, there is yet time.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
You know better than that.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Yes, it is.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Sure looks that way.
Now you're talkin'.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
I saw Karen Sisco.
You know how I felt about her.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
I don't know.
Whatta you wanna do?
I get that feeling, yeah.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Jack --
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
In the trunk, yeah?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Excuse me, Adele?
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
How are you, Raymond?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
No, I didn't know that.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Wait, I know him --okay?
There a problem, Foley?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I thought everything.
Someone down here?
Not until recently.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
In my bag, in the car.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
I thought so, too.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Bleeding on a country road.
Yes.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
How do we do that?
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Love it.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
She did, huh.
Why are you mad?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
You gonna write me a check?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
That time?
Glenn?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Great.  We got one of 'em.
How you know that?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
What do you want?
Thanks.
Your dog was killed?
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Oh, he's moved out?
Hello?
Like a fag.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Well, I need that...
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
Red...Strange?
Sir?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
He did.
Good shooting, Rafe!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Yeah.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
What facts are those?
So what are you saying?
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Fuck you.
Come on!
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
Home of the brave.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Home of the Brave.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Hang on.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Y-Yes Sir.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
You too, Lieutenant.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
Brilliant, Admiral.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
Have the planes made it to China?
God help them.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
All of 'em.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
Aren't we a little old for that?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Don't say that...
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I know. Put Scott through college.
I'm not going.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Refresh my memory.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Thanks.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Save it.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Let's go down to the basement.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
That's real big of you.
Right here. Now sit down.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
I'll never give up.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
What would that be, sir?
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
What're you doing here anyway?
What are you shooting for?
I hate chickens.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Doing some shopping?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Oh. I forgot.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
What was?
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
I	know what a burrito is.
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
I don't know.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
I couldn't help it ÂÂ I loved him.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
I... um...
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
I suppose so.
Yes... why?
Sure.
I'm going out, Dad!
Anywhere but here.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
There's a better place...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
Yeah...
What do you mean?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Andy?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
I promise!
Maybe you should think about it.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
They sabotaged me.
What?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
We're friends of Beckett's.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
I still am.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
I'm an excellent lawyer.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Not unnecessary ones.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
No.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Really?
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Yes.
Thank you. No more questions.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Why are we going to do that?
Get real.
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
That's correct.
It satisfied me.
In a word, yes.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
How many do you know?
Probably since she was born.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Any women on board?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
Jesus.
Charles...
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
They're coming.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
But they...they could still be....
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Big Evil?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
25 kilos each, huh?
Let's wait on the power cells.
That's what I said.
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
I never said I was.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
You know who Muhammad was?
We're all on the same hajj now.
For now.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Rain.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
I'm born-again.
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Say that again.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Just realized that, huh?
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Nice embellishment.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Do you have any weapons?
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
Right now, if you like.
What's so special about him?
Remembers what?
And they fell out of the sky with you?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
No, they won't -
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Him.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Huh?
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
What signal?
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
I don't know.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Taylor, please --
God bless you.
Yes, Sir.
This is his assertion.
But there's the doll, sir.
Where?
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
I got one...
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
Dawn...
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Sounds like it.
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
How do you do?
Why certainly, baby.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I see.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
What did you say his name was?
Whatever you say.
I don't.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Dance? Here?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Nothing matters.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
And Betty Mayfield--
Killaine...
Frozen.
That's right.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
The police always do, don't they?
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
What does he see?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
For two hundred?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Fascinated.
I've got good ears.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
You're not English.
Could we discuss that some other time?
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
He saw my face too.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
You get it's brother.
Open it and count it.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
So the shell ought to have gone over?
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Not if it clears the air.
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
How about Magruder?
How do you do, sir.
I don't know, sir.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Not too far, I hope.
Nice.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
That's not very kind.
What does it look like?
You already have the checks, darling.
In an hour, Larry.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Yes.
Exactly that.
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Thank you.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
And you're at this third stage
I might.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Come on.  Hand over.
It's shit.
Let me see.
You're so gross.
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Yes, finally.
Have you come to talk about me?
Suez.  1956.
What about the Cromwells?
Dad.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
No.
Now listen...
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
Voila!
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Not yet.
De nada.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Fine.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
This Zen master surfer.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Figured you did.
Sure.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
No way, old buddy.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
You know you can't win this one.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
It's been a long time, General.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
There's no sign of it.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
He's not really my uncle.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
No.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
No.
It pays.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
I've known a lot of everybody.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
"Occupational hazard".
Done.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I got a dress, yeah.
Any good?
I have work to do.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Good.
Dinner can wait.
No.
He died a long time ago.
Shall we mingle?
Ready to stomp sod?
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
You won't.
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
I more than liked it.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
He's not gonna want us.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Dummy.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
Kit give me nothin'.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
And who is that?
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
But I always eat like this.
I like steak.
Steak spoon! 
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I don't think it would fit you.
Excuse me?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I will never doubt again.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
He's really very short on charm.
But you don't know where he is.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
What?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
Shall we track them both?
Yes.
And our assets?
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I thought he was with you.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
That does put a damper on our relationship.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
And what is that?
You're sure nobody's following us?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I will. And I choose --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
What?
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
"To my honey I'll croon,
I have hurt your feelings.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Mr. Bialystock ...
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.  We would!
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Come on.  Let's get going.
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Got dag pa dig.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Very nice girl.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Oh, the best one.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
Bismark...
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
What?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
And when she left, she never came back.
Someone is sitting in that window.
If she paid you well?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
What?
Five hundred.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
May I talk to you?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
No.
She'll need both of us.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Yes.
Who's he?
All right! Then call! At least, call!
This is the old highway.
Watch your tenses.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
I could stand something regular.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Sam. This is the last time.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
Don't miss your plane.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
No.
Uncommon, too.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
Good night.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Now what?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Have you two had breakfast?
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Do what?
Mother, please...
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Did I?
What--special autopsy?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Indeed, he has often told me.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
Who are you? What is your name?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
The wound is bleeding!
That called ... commanded ...
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
It happens that I'm the law.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
We'll grant that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
He can't hear you.
Excuse me???
I could go out of town.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
Where is she?
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
I said I wouldn't.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Five hundred rabbits?
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
What did you say, Brother?
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
She's watching the car again?
Is that all?
Buddy, that was my place.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Then why does she act so dumb?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
No, son, she is dead.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Oh. Did you say something?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
You're not having lunch?
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Yes, of course.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
What did you forget?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Over... my... dead... body!
Who?
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Yes, sir.
Galley proof.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Illusions, Madam?
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I don't mind.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
You're not gonna see him again.
... okay... you made your point.
What and?  That's what I got.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
What... ?
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
What do you want me to do about it?
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
No you can't.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I'm just saying...
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Yeah.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Clench your teeth.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Entertainers don't count.
Same day as before.  I think.
Bullshit.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
What was I supposed to do?
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
There probably is.
We've got the tape to prove it.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
Murderer?  Really?
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
I know it is, even if you don't.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Dead.
Gimmie a minute.
Just got here.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
I'm well aware of that.
Keep 'em busy.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
I can't see.
Where am I?
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
His lightsaber.
How are we doing?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Good, I hate long waits.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Quiet.
Oh, no.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Yes.
Disintegrated?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Janet.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
No, don't do that.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
You know this earth - this person.
A decision had to be made.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
I didn't make him for you
Now I
Oh my, my,
Like I'm outside in the rain
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...I don't know.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Do you have a phone?
Yes, I do.
I think he might be worried.
It's not that --
No, I don't belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I should leave.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
I'll be waiting.
Don't want weak legs.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Paul.
Christ.
It's not your house --
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
...It's very American.
...Still don't feel no heat.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it.
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
No action.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Why?
What?
Yeah.
...No.
Ya puttin' me on?
Freak luck for sure.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Fine... That guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
Great, kid, great.
It ain't your locker no more.
He ain't losin' nothin'.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
I'm thirty myself.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
...Tight.
...No.
Sure I like her.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I'll bet.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
So you're Cloverleaf?
That's right, me.
Toon cops worked me over.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Eddie, come on.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
I don't work in Toontown.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
I've already seen your photographs.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Take it easy.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Me.
No, it's not.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I rest my case.
Yeah?
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Good idea.
From this box here...
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Why, what is Tybalt?
In love?
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Art thou hurt?
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Romeo, come forth.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Ay me!
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Ahhh!
Well what shall I swear by?
If my heart's dear love--
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
What?
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
That's why you were riding with him.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
You lose them!
Not yet...
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Is that right?
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
I didn't say I was.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
You sure about this?
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
I take it you still want the money...
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
How did you know?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Not for long.
Why don't you go do better, then...
Who's they?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I don't think so.
No thanks.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
Know what?
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
It's my job.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Very ugly.
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Finish it!
What?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
Gonna be tough.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
The Russian would be easier.
I hear you.
Seven thousand...
Never heard of it.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
All right we will.
What are you thinking?
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
He killed her...
Why don't you get to the point.
What's your offer, Jesse?
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Just take it in stride.
No.  It's not.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Has he?
Nothing happened?
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
I love you Sally.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I don't believe it.
You know I do.
What did he buy?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
We appreciate that.
What are you getting at?
Why would someone do that?
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
We are having a sale on some items over here --
No, I can't say that I have.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
All right youÂre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Sort of.
Yeah whaddya want?.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne put the gun down --
What?
I was on a roll!  IÂm a little overextended now.
So I want the money and I want it now.
Yeah.
And what happened?
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Give me the bad news.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Is this about the funny money?
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
No.
No.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
I'm sorry.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
This is a very dangerous man.
Don't look at my ass!
Who?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
No.  She's a school teacher.
IT IS CRAZY!
Why LA?
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What?
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
End of the line.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
This money is evidence.
The Plaza Hotel?
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Fine with me.
Baby Duck?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
I know, Master, but...
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Carter.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
I was being polite.
It was not my intent --
I know a shortcut.
Don't go there...
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yes, I know this song.
Who does not know War?  ĹWar, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.Ë
It's him.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
They put you in charge?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Or somethin'.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I still have work to do here.
I was trying to find the right time.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
"Make the shot."
"Never say die."
His hair... any color.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Where do you think she's going?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Then you'll be my best man.
Looking for Maggie.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Yes.
You have one?
A pre-wedding luau?
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Seven-fifty.
Still sweet.
Of course.
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I'd rather not.
A little longer for me.
Well, you do have the dress.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
Quick.  Very quick.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
Is there somebody else?
You don't love me, is that it?
So you're angry.  Big deal.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
No.
You couldn't.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
So what happened?
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Nothing's with me.
Actually, he sounded nice.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I should say something in this about magic.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
"I want to meet you..."
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
M.F.E.O.?
Okay.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
A sense of humor.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I know. 
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
Any time.
Destiny takes a hand.
What?
Mom, we already...
Magic.
It's me?
The cabinets have to be redone --
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Seventy... eight.
Yeah.  What's that?
It plays in 50 states.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Stressed.
What do you think?
What?
Whose show was this on?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
I know.
I don't know.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Oh, right.
There she is.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
It's a short word.
This conversation is finished.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
If I didn't go.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Whose side are you on anyway?
I say we gotta take action. Now.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Yeah.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
So much the better.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Yes. We will light the candles.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
With RamĂłn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
What has it got me, your union?
Never... never... never!
Antonio paid for it.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
What makes you so sure?
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
You should have helped her without being asked.
What attitude?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
The spiders.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Not even a guess?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Ouch.
Colette ...
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
This has nothing to do with him.
Therapy session is over.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Ass first into the world.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Twelve
You don't say.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
Sorry.
10%.  That's ...
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
I don't trust anybody.
That was my idea.
No, I'm good.
Secret recipe.
Hey, okay.
Why do you say that?
Pull your pants down.
Big Bill.
Okay! Okay!
I'll keep that in mind.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Yeah, dickhead.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Jesus.
What's he holding?
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Again, I thank you.
There's no motels around here.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
What is it, drugs?
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Figured.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Shut up, will you?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
I guess.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Like hell, you did.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
A half-track, anything.
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
Pass.
Where are you from, Captain?
I don't expect to live that long.
Did he see any sign of them?
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I changed my mind.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
What about Talbot?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
How about I go right, sir?
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Yeah.
Bits and pieces.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
I think you're right, Keith.
Just what I want to do.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Yeah, how so?
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
HERE THEY COME!
Here they come.
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Yes, sir.
And Sarge?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
You're sure?
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
What's a scam?
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Oh yeah!
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
I just had a phone call.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Dad.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Okay, I give up.
You're going.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Yes, I...
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
You're right.
Look at those eyes.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Hmmm....
Pardon me?
No.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Job?  Being a great date.
Today is tomorrow.
Okay, bye, I will.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
What did you say?
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Be friends?
Yeah?
Right.
Yeah.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
It was wonderful.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
We decided...
No, no.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
No I didn't.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Man, you're bringing me down!
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
She's very successful.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
No way.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I love you too.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Sir, the list is correct.
Oskar, please -
I'm sorry to hear that.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
I pay you too much.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
Look it up.
Of course I'm on it.
Yeah, okay.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Christmas presents.
And killing.
I think it's too late.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Yes.
They arrived, can you believe it?
There will be generations because of what you did.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
They've broken their pattern.
Where?
Stop it...
I'm losing you.
Where is everybody?
That's too bad.
No, it's me.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
I live here.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
You could start with an apology.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
YouÂre all in this together?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Not one bit.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
The forbidden subject.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Hope youÂre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
Tails.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Yeah, right.
Dewey, there's no such place.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Watch your back.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Easy black boy.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Hello.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Closer than you think.
To see your reaction.
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
To me Hollywood is about death.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
What did you know about your mother?
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
What does this have to do with Sid?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Always.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Do you want us to come with you?
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Sure.
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Oh shit it's my cell!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
What the hell are you doing?
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
They're the ones who approved it.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Who's this.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
You know it.
Oh yeah.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
What are you doing here?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
I'm going... I'm going.
What's that?
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
It's okay. We need to talk.
You lost your mom...
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Really? What?
Do you like scary movies?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Don't...
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
More of a game, really.
They'd never make it in time.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
No...
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Come on, yes you do.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
You never know when or where a story will break.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
What were you doing out here?
What is it? Where's Casey?
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Has his story changed?
I saw him leaving wearing it.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Uh-huh.
Who are you?
Can you knock?
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Twice.
Don't shoot. It's me.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
I'll be right back.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
No way.
Later.
Whatever. Just hurry.
I bet he's pissed.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Come on, let's rock.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Deal.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
What am I? The beer wench?
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
What are you talking about?
I heard.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
It would be too hard.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
You'll see.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
Spit it out.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
What the fuck is going on here?!
What the fuck is going on?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I realize that.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
What?
Good.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Nothing.
Bear with me.
Just wait!
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
I'm fine.
We need a warrant.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
We had him.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
What did you say?
I can't let you do this...
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
I want to have children.  It's just...
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
No sir...pleasure.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
How many, would you say?
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
You got it with you?
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
He just couldn't wait...
Scar?
But I just bought a good blanket.
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Cut it out, will ya...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Never heard of him...
It's what I'm countin' on.
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I got your boy killed.
No...not yet...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Finish your breakfast...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
I just had a really strange experience.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Someone from the village.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
I haven't the slightest idea.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
I've killed my husband!
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
It's good.
Ten pounds.
Done.
Nothing comes.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
That's me.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Put his feet in.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Oh, that.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
it will be all right, madam.
To my weekly confession.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
I will.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
And I love poetry above all.
Oh, but they can!
There was a wager, I rememberÂas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"Madam!"
"Madam!"
I have lost my gift.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Is she obedient?
You have opened the playhouses?
But the plague
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Oh, not for the world!
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
It is strange to me, too.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
A literary feud. Quite normal.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
You cannot marry Wessex!
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
OrsinoÂgood name
and thus unable to declare her love
Write me well.
My lord.
I will do my duty, my lord.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
A theatre poet?
Serve.
Just serve.
Will you shut up and play.
About what?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
You call them if you want.
I don't hear this.
There was a break-in.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
Your friends.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
About the mail --
Where do you think you'll go?
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Just serve.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Yeah.
His car's still there.
So what's wrong with that?
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
And now you tell me.
It tastes different.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
What are you doing here?
David?
Forget it.
I'll wait there.
Alex.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
You were going to say something.
did you hear anything before he cries?
Who said there were four?
Someone lost the key.
No one.
It was on the television.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
It wasn't like that.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Yes, sir.
What happened to that guy?
That's what I thought.
Would you like to see the rest?
A priest who dies.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
It's an improvement.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
The first one was fine.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
That you were just indulging me.
What do you expect me to do about it?
What are you talking about?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I don't want to see you anymore.
Calm down, baby.
What about?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Hello, George.
... what?...
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
Okay.
No thanks.
Why?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
I am not!
Right.
They are?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
I'd cut it...
Yeah... I mean great.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And what?
Did Lester know about him?
Yeah?
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
I don't want to... I swear...
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Fuckin' A --
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- mmm --
-- well you better go after her.
-- you've got to leave.
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
It's too late...
Don't go, Jackie...
-- please, please forgive me...
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Okay... thanks...
Great, great. I hope you make it.
What're you talking about?
What's gonna happen?
You said somebody... who?
No shit?
Keep moving --
What?
Honey, what happened?
-- Sure.
What!
Yeah, baby.
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Who?
Look at the way I live.
Commercials.
-- go ahead.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Where did this come from?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
What did you say?
Thank you.
Yes it is.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
Oh, hey...
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
I know.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Yes I do.
What?
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back...
Yeah.
Okay.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
George is going to open a shop.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Why not?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
-- no.
He's a hairdresser.
-- oh I don't know --
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Yes, Dad.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Do you feel bad?
Dad?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Yeah.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Danny!
Oh!
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Advocaat is it?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
A nigger.
A nigger cook.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Sure.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Yeah... that's all it is.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
Which room was it?
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Jack...
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Of course you are.
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Wendy!
Go away.
Wendy...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Thank you, Susie.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
I don't get you.
Yeah! What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
We won't!
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
What about crack?  You a user?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
You know what we're saying!
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
And you listen to that?
With love.
What?
Today was the deadline, Vince.
Joey -- do it.
What is it, Betty?
Oh my! 
Right.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Just about.  Show me again.
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Chops?
Am I?
That man -- who is he?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
It's true -- I know her.
Pay attention...
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Mary Robert.
I knew that.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
What?  What time is it?
Excuse me?
She won't?  Why not?
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
You watch yourself!
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Keep moving!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
It's true!
Enough joking.
Very well.
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
What?
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Would you like that?
Like to who?
Mary Clarence!
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
Out of the question.
What do you mean?
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
Oh?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
He didn't do you a favor.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Me too.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Hail, Mary.
Really.
They open a window.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
Maybe. 
Not... totally.
Yeah...
That's what I figured, too.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
That was exciting!
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
She's our inspiration!
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
But where?
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
I know. 
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Many have.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Excuse me?
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
I shall, gladly.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
How could he?
Father said witches live there.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
What does it mean?
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Small talk.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Are you so superstitious?
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
If you want.  But...
I insist that you have it.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
It was not butchery.
To avenge his father, and the others.
What troubles you?
No, but... why do you ask that?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
Just... keep where you are.
The skull is gone.
Come with me.
And, what did he say?
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Yes.  Here...
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Doctor, he is awake.
She did not do it... please listen...
No.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I like them french-fried potaters.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Good to know you, Karl.
Give me the big'uns.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
What?
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I hate you!
I know Albert. We're friends.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Childers.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah.
All right then.
If you want me to.
Yeah.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
No sir.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Okay.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
Yeah.
Yes, I guess you are.
You better go get 'em.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Naw.
My history.
No ma'am.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Not really to speak of.
Did you knock on the door yet?
How long have you been standing here?
I reckon not.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Why won't he talk to women?
Before they were married?
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Signs?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Five thousand bucks.
I almost got married once.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
And these?
What does that mean?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
I shouldn't have let him go.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Just passing through.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Well what?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
The what?
You can't be more specific than that?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
Yeah, I can believe it.
Drawing's a good thing.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty?
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
You work too hard, you know that?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
The inspiration.
No way.
The end.
His only copy?
That money is my whole future.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I'm not going to do it.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Medium rare, please.
Carl Heine's type.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Well, it seems to me...
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
And the next one...?
And the last...?
Twelve.
He didn't want to lose any more.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Carl Heine came.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Fell.
Still lashed to the mast.
I think you like learning.
It is.
Apparently.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bull fiddle.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Hey, Joe!
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Quiet - I'm thinking.
We're not too late, are we?
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Now you've done it!
Tore off one of my chests.
Down, Daphne!
Then pull the emergency brake!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
He's going to be ashore with you.
Have I got things to tell you!
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
I may throw up.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
No, no.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I may spill something.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Come on, Daphne.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
I hope so.
Yes.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
- you got to be blonde -
Personally, I'm Type O.
You don't say.
I'm not surprised.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Why?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Yes, Osgood?
Sorry.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
Oh, no!
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
It's three weeks in Florida -
Yes, Joe.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
You got to be under twenty-five -
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Have you ever been with a male band?
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Just my feminine intuition.
My fault.
Not at all.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Well, I'm not.
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
- riding to hounds -
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
If it's at all possible -
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
They shrink when they're marinated.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
You mean you can't fall in love?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Booze.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
I never join nothin'.
Why?
Yes, sir.
You don't owe me no nothing.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
ThereÂs finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Oh, shut up and be happy. ItÂs always this or that. YouÂre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youÂre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youÂve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnÂt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnÂt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I donÂt know, but your misery just isnÂt working for me anymore.
Or Kat....
Whatever you do, donÂt mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Why, with you.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
I had to say something to get you here.
DonÂt be ridiculous. ItÂs late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
No, tell me.
Hello, Katmandu.
Let me guess. Amy presumed IÂd forget the rings.  I think IÂm her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like weÂre trying too hard to look like we fit.  ItÂs welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Really?  DonÂt get too attached.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
YouÂre too good for him.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youÂre so cute, IÂll take care of our incidentals.
ThatÂs right. Imagine facing it alone.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Shampoo, got it!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
First of all, itÂs never out of the blue. And second of all--
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, ÂLove Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.Â Trust me, IÂm careful.
IÂve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think itÂs the words: Âmorally repugnant.Â
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
ItÂs my job.
So, whyÂd you say yes to me?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Thank you.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Is there any other way to take it?
At least somebodyÂs using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
I try...
Colored.
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
Nothin'...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
She was dirty and wet...
No, Miss Johnson...
It was too dark, Daddy.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Goodnight to you, son...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Yes, David...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
That's right!
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Good night...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Might be...
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Is there something I can do to help you?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
Pillow.
Eric!
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
How the fuck should I know!!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
I don't know.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Baba mama!
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
MOM!!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
For pooping, silly.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Yeah, they suck.
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Yes?
Right away, ma'am!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
You bet, Terrance!
Canada is saving us!!
Hey, come here, guy.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Hey, relax guy!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
That's nice, Stan.
Yup.
What's the matter, Wendy?
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Anna...
They're not going to make it!
You're Warren Wayne.
Magnificent, magnificent.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Of course, of course...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Very professional of you.
The device has stopped responding.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Will you shut up already?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Why can't we?
I understand.
Helllp!
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Taylor!  Where are you?
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Try not to think about it.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Send it back if you don't want it.
Baby, take it easy.
Mac.  What's shaking?
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
The pin machine?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Lemme see your ball.
La da da dalala...
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Theo.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
It's mine.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
I'm your blood.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
He says that to all his wives.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Who's there?
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Who's there?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Someone wants to play with me?
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
I like the sport the way it is.
Why would you help me?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
You still got the touch Junior.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
They suspended me.
He's my father, Millie.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
The mental hospital.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
So why do you stay?
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
You got any broken bones?
It's Junior, isn't it.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
It?
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Tell me what happened Theo.
Are you sure he's dead?
At least I'll die smiling.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
Suck my dick!
I'm not here to bowl.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
It's burning...
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
What was that?
What if it attacks?
High Voltage?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Captain.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Nothing else.
They didn't tell me anything.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
What team?
Take a look.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Pull it.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Yes, Harry.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
What's the message?
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
What is it?
What do you make of this?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
What's inside the sphere.
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
What -- are you threatening me?
What?
Beth --
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Beth --
I have to reset the sub.
In case you die, too?
I would.  But my suit --
He what?
Fixing it.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
What?
Squids?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Tarazine?
Bingo.
Antibiotic.
How long does it last?
I'll just boost the doses.
You think I'd really drink that?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
But I have to, Norman.
Get away from the door, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For whoever's in that thing.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Like what?  I'm not --
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
I'm not being defensive.
Wait a second, I --
Whatever I can do to help.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
What noise?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
What are they?
I thought she was with you.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
I don't think so.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hold on.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
No idea.
Wait!
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Please.  It must have flown here --
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
The ships?
What report?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Who's everyone?
This is like nursery school.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Not that I know of.  Why?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
What?
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
All right then, we'll use your plan.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
Could I learn to feel it?
That's where my father was killed.
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
He's bluffing...
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
He can't find Organa Major.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
I'll make a report later.
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Was this trip really necessary?
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
It's automatic.
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
With four casualties?!
Who is this?  What's your operating...
They'll find its weakness.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
What's the hurry ?
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I got Games & Theory.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Only when I give you an order.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
You and me, huh ?
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Your turn...
Who ?
I have good reflexes.
I don't want everyone to see.
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
I'll meet you outside.
Good luck at the academy.
You two have so much in common.
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
I'll go for that.
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
How are you, Carl ?
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
How come we never got together ?
No thanks, Diz.
You saying you didn't ?
Flip six, three hole.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
All bands.
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Aw, don't get mushy.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
Been better, buddy.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Give'em hell, sir !
You may proceede.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
May I ask Why?
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Mr Decker....
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
It's taken control of the computer...!
This served the purpose.
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Ten seconds....
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Aye, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Sit down, please.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
There is no alternative.
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
To you, sir?
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
Sure plan to.
Yes.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
And likewise.
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
Yes...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
You'd know better'n me.
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Yes.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
One moment.
Read the card.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
I used to go out with a politician.
I can't get it to come out right.
<u>Please</u>...
I hurt you?
Hi.
What?
Is it...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
But that's what happened.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Morning, darling.
Yes, that's right.
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
We had a date.
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Who is this person that you've found?
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
Nothing happened.

Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
We've got three days to...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
Everybody needs a hob...
I've always seen that.
It's night.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
She's absolutely r...
I, actually yes.
I like you, too.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I...I...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...yes...
We, we have to give it.
The minute I read that script I said...
Marty...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
She won't stop crying...
Who got their heads cut?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
Doug, this is Mr...
What is the...?
This young woman.
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Later for you, pal.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
A witness to what...?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
I can't find the writer.
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I don't drink.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
The girl was in the car.
So be it.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
We don't have the money.
There's no witnesses...
Is he cool or angry?
Sherry, Sherry...
...it is?
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Bet you did.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
I bet.
And...?
She is but an arriviste.
Great.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
Thank God for that!
And this is my room so get out!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
MOMMY!
Honey, she won't d...
That doesn't bother me.
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Not use my words, please!
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
There you are!
Annabelle let's get something clear.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
I knew where I was all the time.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Is that like Luigi's?
Where are you, anyway?
Is your bad?
Before you.
Rache says it's from you.
So where are you?
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Every day.  More and more.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
You think I didn't get that?
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
You're WHERE?
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
We're going to win this.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Anxiety.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Brad Kovitsky.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
And her...?
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Aw.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
Double.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
You're the hip and fresh.
I have their past.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
That's not us.
What?
He was in a concentration camp?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
This is work.
I know!
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process betterÂ
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
How was the class?
Fine.
You mean, again?
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
OK!
What are you doing here?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Again!
Again!!
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Hello, is this Pam?
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Eight, six, and four.
Yeah, sure.
Maybe she has caller ID.
No, I don't think so...
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Well get someone down there!
We don't have time!
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
I guess not Cooper...
Even better.
Are you going to kill us?
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
Shut up!
What!
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
We can't--it's power driven!
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
What does that mean?
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Don't be ridiculous.
I know nothing of the sort!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Didn't they tell you?
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
That's government property, Major.
General Schmuck?
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
A shooting war!
You're right, sir.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
To peace on earth.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
I presume the planes are armed?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
What the hell is Plan-R?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Speed?
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
They're moving apart.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Very interesting.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
What are you talking about?
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But who would be chosen?
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
I don't anymore.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
What did you guys think?
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
What's it about?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
The dude wants it.
That's the rock star thing.
Sorry.
Ah!
No, no.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
No. It didn't, Buff.
She's dead.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey.
Shit.
In what way?
I can come visit?
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Are you talking to me?
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Hey, thanks, man.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I could.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is?
Mm.
Military marching bands.
Really?
Yeah?
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
He's drunk.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
What?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Is that Bee-Bee?
Look, look, just get off my property.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
About what?
Name one.
Hey!
But do you stand for anything?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
I would've stopped it.
Sooze.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Mm.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I don't know.
Well, what about this?
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
New York, huh?
Mine too.
You done?
If...
Mm-hm.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Oh, my god!
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
About what?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Don't do that, man, okay?
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
I'm here.
Hey, Tim.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Come on, Jeff.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
You know the fuck not.
Sorry, Kansas...
Cleo!
Wayne Gretzky.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
No...I've been pregnant.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
Y'think?
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Uh...maybe?
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
More proof God's a guy...
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
I hear she was a terror to work with.
In a deep freeze.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
What's wrong with it?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
What teacher?
You did?
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
Well, for heaven's sake!
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
I don't want it now.
Whose?
Why did she call me?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
It is not.  Get out.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Get out!
Why?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
And you'll play Salome?
December twenty-first.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Come here!
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
"Mad about the boy."
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
I think I'll read a little.
Why do you say that?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
No, they don't.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Wipe your feet!
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
Is that So?
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
But where?
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Who didn't?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
No.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Just like that?
I sort of like what you said.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
Miss what?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
It was just a trim.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
No, MR. Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Cigarette?
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
A cheap trick.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
For what?
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Criminals.
Why?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Clark.
Who?
You thought that?
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Can I help?
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
What!
Say!
Mmmmm . . .
Yeah.
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Black or regular?
First question got to be "Where."
God, that's what I keep you for.
They ain't got captains?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Fair's fair.
What will it do?
Tell me more...
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
Watch out for them air pockets!
We gonna crash?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
I didn't have my camera with me.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
But the bridge...
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
But the other night...
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Hello.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Today coffee----
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Don't bet on it!
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
In July???
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Oh, hi.
I'm sorry.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Cuba.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
. . . Let me get my purse.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
I'm not so sure you do.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
I'm sorry.
Absolutely!
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Something . . . wonderful.
Our other dinner guest.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
You're just an experiment, freako!
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
What?
Wait! Not yet! Back!
I am master now.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Nobody else.
We're running out of smoke.
Got it? Otis?
I've been on the job.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Not really, no.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Screaming
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Tough guy, huh?
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
You?! How about me?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
What's your name, boy?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
There are none of them any good anyway.
He is. Usually.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Sure.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I...uh...check.
Otis...
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
How are you?
Which clinic?
It turns to steaming piss.
That's okay.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Goodnight, Nicole.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
C'mon, you know that won't...
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Can't you make it later?
Berry-picking.
Did they give him special care?
Hi, Dolores.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
I'll...take it straight.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Yes.  It's a present.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
It's the truth.
That's what he said.
Okay.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
You hate that.
You seem very sure about that.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Crafts?
Thanks.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Well, let's see what we get.
Who are you?
You can't come here.
No.
You've been retained?
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
No.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Dolores was driving too fast.
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
I don't know.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
Yeah, right.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Is "he" inside?
Alone or surrounded?
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Hurry back.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
No, I wouldn't...
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
J.J., Steve isn't...
No.  I'm going home.
Now don't kid a kidder.
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Can I come in for a minute?
Not just this minute, J.J....
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Get Steve back his job...please...
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
What about?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
What sort of thing?
I know you do, Sidney.
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
What ship?
Like you?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
If the stores are open -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
What chip?
Let me try mine.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Liquid metal.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Why?
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No problemo.
I'm sorry, John.
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
No.  There is another chip.
Yes.
Relax now, Sarah --
Eating is eating... and...
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Your manner.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
I have a duty.
Yes.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
What's not right?
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
And what was that?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
No!
Tell me about von der Null.
Yes, von der Null.
And what did he say?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
What?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Never heard of him, who is he?
The Miracle Kid.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Right. Claims assessor.
They said I was dogged?
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
You're late.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
I won't let the fat kid down.
You're a big help.
I thought you did.
That's none of your business.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Freezing.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
You like it?  It's my first.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What about it?
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
You must have had a fun child-
I want it to be over for you.
Someone?
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Yes.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Of course.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I know.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
The stock will turn.
Did you?  Kudos.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
I said I was sorry...
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't think he's breathing.
What... is... happening... ?
Why not?
You pull me up.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Can we talk?
Well... the red bra.
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
What's wrong?
Nicholas...
Get out.
Get out of my car!
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
What are you talking about... ?
I didn't say anything.
Who the fuck cares?
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Stop talking to them!
Big family... small?
Underwear?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
You shouldn't have.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Stop it!
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
No, thank you.
What kind of vacation?
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
It was a different floor then...
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
The key?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight.  Where was she?
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Don't ask.
Follow me.
It was a misunderstanding.
You're joking.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Just stay there, Nell!
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
-- how much is this car worth?
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
I don't know.
It was.
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
How'd I know it was for you?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Oh!  You scared me.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Why would we --
I don't know what you mean.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I know.
You're okay.
What's his first name?
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
-- What do you think?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
Come over here.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Lookin' good.
No reason.
Y'what?
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
And that's where you met Jenny.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What post office?
Well, those are the breaks.
It's been a while.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Footloose and fancy free.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
That's what was estimated.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Based in London, but with international concerns.
What do you think.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
What'd your father do?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
What's in Big Sur?
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
No kidding.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Where else?
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Good luck.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Lemme break.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Walked.
What do you think?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Ah.
Be seein' you.
Who?
Hello, Birdy.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Huh.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Well? How'd she do?
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
No. I--tell me--
Yeah.
No, Dave, I wasn't.
How's business, Dave?
All right, I guess.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Huh?
Big Dave--
Told what?
Honey?
Honey...
How are you?
You don't have to--
...OK.
It was Big Dave's.
*I* was with her.
I took Doris's keys.
...I don't think so.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...who among us is in a position to say...
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Yeah.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
Uh-huh.
What'd he say?
Hello.
Not an owner.
Homicide.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Calm down.  I found it!
Hurry up!
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
What doors?
Where the hell are you?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
You're kidding.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
I know.
Oh shit.
All right everybody, hold up!
I don't believe it.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
I'm not giving up.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
What are they?
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Look who's here, Margo.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Big as a house.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
What's that?
It's reptilian.
Okay.
And John?
You were going to be married.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
One.
Today.
That's right.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's to see?
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
That and a fat, new contract.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Certainly a nomination.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Shhh!
That's right.  Lauren.
Now.
So when are you leaving?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
Who?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
What's that?
I've been thinking--
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I made macaroni.
I don't know--
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You hate gambling.
You blaming me for the traffic?
I bet you did.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
Oh, just so.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
I'll try.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
There's no one here.
You can count on it.
Yeah.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
There are complications.
You got some kind of business with him?
No. Don't bother.
And one little boy.
How?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
I think they have that covered.
What happened to playing a hunch?
Something sweet.
Scully, I found the bomb.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
No.
I don't know.
Mulder --
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I have no idea.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
Thank you.
She was with me.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I have answers for you.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What alien environment?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
A pocketful of rye...
Lucien Baines?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Why did we stop?
He needs to be turned over.
I don't need them anymore...
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Do you think that's funny?
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
It doesn't matter...
I got it.
He's beautiful...
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Now?
It's his dog.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
He has a little dog.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Yes.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
Oh...
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
I'm sorry.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Why are you lying?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Of course.
Thank you.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
I have never seen him.
It wasn't important.
Two weeks ago.
It's true then?
I don't want it.
Yes, of course.
Best thing that ever happened...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
You're not locking her up?
A bruised lip.
In Vienna...
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
Bring him in.
I'm not asking you to.
Thank you. Excuse me.
I see.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
She's right. It's none of my business.
You all did.
Two thirty.
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Who?
Never heard of him.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
A Roumanian.
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
What's the name of this girl?
The Roumanian?
How do you do.
In great pain?
What's he saying?
You don't mean that doctor?
Well make it your business.
I am not a bad man.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Here.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
So how many miles do you think it is?
Yes.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Two.
Eh - bonsoir.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Where did you lose it?
Uh-huh.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
They don't have extermination camps.
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Fire...
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Why the fuck not?
Disease? What disease?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
I just read it....
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Oh, really?
Then how come you're talking to me?
What's it mean?
V'asitem...
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
You shouldn't.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Do they?
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
They're liars and cowards.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
What about Curtis Zampf?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
A poison...?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Notice? Like what...?
I don't know. Is that right?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Female...
He has Israel.
Are all Jews the same?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
No.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
A forty-five.
You're lying.
But I wasn't.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
It's German.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Fine.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
A Jewish prayer.
Why? Why would she?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Wow, that's uh...great...
Why me?
I was a Jew in a previous life.
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Obviously.
Funny?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
The documents are forged.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Hello!
Yes.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
In a lake.
No.
Have you known him long?
Okay.
Congratulations, Enzo.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
What are you doing here?
I won't, I swear.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
What does that mean?
Six seconds.
Then tell him to wax it too.
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
He's training.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
The rules are the rules.
Noireuter.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
No...
Yes, I know.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
... For the mermaids.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
Yes.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
I don't want to erase anything.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
You say that because you have the title!
We saw each other a little while ago.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
I don't know... why?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Johana... New York.
... Sally?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Haven't you been listening?
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Yes... It's magic.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
It's Esther.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
Worse.
That's some cold shit.
No, it was the perfect level.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
What about me?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
I drink.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
No. I'm serious about this.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
What do you want to see him for?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Who?
Go on -Â
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too ÂÂ when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret ÂÂ a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
That's right, of course.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
More or less.
I don't know.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ÂÂ  Don't you?
That was a calamity!
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
No Â- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -Â turn off the lights ÂÂ
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
And I never will- you know what's between us Â we're a thing But this is serious competition.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
And not a sign of the leopard?
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
What! You can't be --
I know -- Teresa -Â
AinÂt nobody out there, Mister.
You a tourist?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Disney! How inter...
Excuse me?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Oh no. YouÂll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Excuse me?
Perhaps I should come back when youÂre...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
CouldnÂt Nazi hunters do the job?
You drive a hard bargain.
You do want me to keep the job, donÂt you, Mrs De Moraes?
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Why donÂt you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Sorry?
Why... I donÂt know what youÂre talking about.
No!
Think what you like. But donÂt presume to understand.
Good.
You splendid bastard...
Here we go again.
What are you doing? You canÂt. I...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
Well, IÂd sooner mug an old lady...
No. A poor little rich boy who thought heÂd save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For godÂs sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
Yeah.
What about an untrained pup, white...
I see. How much?
No... No...  I swear...
What?
The company. We all work for the company.
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. HeÂs got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Look Mrs Spitz... I donÂt know to whom IÂm indebted for the recommendation but... IÂm not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
No. And before you ask, no, heÂs not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with LeonardÂs address, keys and other things you might need. 
My rates...
Does it matter?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, letÂs go...
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Hyatt... FriedmanÂs... at the Hyatt...
Yeah.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Yes. You wouldnÂt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Shut up! WhereÂs your wallet?
Can I get up now?
HavenÂt you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? IÂd have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Shut up!
Good reasons?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Yes...You-youÂre not going to take Shiva away?
Oh, I... She just moved. IÂve got her new... ItÂs in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
HowÂs the boy doing?
Good. You neednÂt worry about the Austrian anymore. HeÂs dead. IÂll be in touch.
Los Angeles?
Eh bien... TÂes sĹąr que tÂas besoin de moi?  La petite mÂa lÂair assez bien foutue, non?
Alors quoi?
Figlio di puttana. YouÂre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Shut up and walk...
ItÂs a good guess...
I donÂt know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
That's a good idea, sire.
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Yes, my lord.
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Now?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
But it is what I want.
But... why... what's the point?
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I don't know...
Yes...
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
What about you?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Not unless you hear my confession.
And may I go to Mass?
You have nothing to regret...
He's feeling wonderful.
Buying her?
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
You think?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Yes.
That's not a lot.
Yes... they were.
For what?
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
Damn right!
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Jeanne, look behind you.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
No.
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What are you doing on the wall?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Yes.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
He'll be back before curfew.
Let's find out.
How will we sleep?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
What's happened?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Thanks.
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
They were taking you away.
Hungry.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Yes, so did the Germans.
So, what's the news?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
I was listening, Kitten.
Where are we going?
Stop it, Wladek.
Sorry, I don't remember.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
To be deaf?
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
That is good, yes.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
No, no bible readers.
On your property?
I'd like to make a swap.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
They are washed.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
I just want to listen.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
You've missed this bit.
Do I know any gigs?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Who told ya this guy was in here?
He'll probably fall down.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
No.
Here.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
I had some appointments.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You think my play is bad?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Which one?
What do ya want the others to get?
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
I picked something up on the way.
You know anything about him?
Why?
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Then you'll do it?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Yeh, it was easy.
He threatened to kill me.
Did he hold you up on anything?
I thought I'd lost him.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
I also gotta win.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Five and call.
Raise 5,000.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
But I got a train to make.
Sixty-five.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
He cheats.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
We missed him.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Never heard of the place.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He was?
You know how they are... sex...
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
It's all right.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Nothing.
What are you talking about?
You're talking like a crazy person,
You're high enough.
And I'll give then proof!
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
I've got to see you alone!
Where did you hit her?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Forgive me.  How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
What would your mother say to that?
He's all right.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
We were looking for this bird.
No.
Man to man, I'm not.
Who's your candidate?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
No.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I guess all the suspects are here.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Want to take a poke at him?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Just what I said I'd do.
Never mind.
Don't you remember....
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Yes?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Good.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Never mind.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
Hello, Mimi.
What do you think?
They'll want more than your word for that.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
I didn't knock Julia off.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
This is your party.
That last Martini.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Yes.
That's jolly.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
No.  Nobody but you.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me.
I don't know.
It's the only way it makes sense.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
No... no.
Yes.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Home!
I'm fired.
It's a fortune box.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
You just go when I say go.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Let me see the map.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
What am I supposed to do?
I heard!
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
What if I do?
What about Jaeger?
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
No you're not.
Wait.  Wait.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Oh, that's fun.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
We leave it.
I heard it click.
I heard it.
Just relax.
Epps...
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Shut up and listen!
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
It's giving.
Is it dead?
Jesus, Jaeger.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Damn.
Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
Probably.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
Shi'ites, I think.
The...the gold...
When did you make the switch?
But...
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Then I'm a rich man.
Thanks.
What?
How the hell should I know?
What?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
What?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
If!  If there's a treasure.
How the hell should I know how much?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Guess we know what the next stop is.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Correct.  Origin?
Now.
Don't go.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Look,dirt!
No!  Don't go.
I don't know.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
AH UGH.
No one can see us now we're alone.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
We're leaving.
Why are you so concerned?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
All the insides are gone!
I thought of something.....
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Officer Reilly, vice.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Hey, look--
You mentioned something called Redstone.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Where you guys at?
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Stay to your left.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Hey, I'm next.
Reilly! He's loaded!
Who is he?
Thank you.
People are dying.
Security.
Shut up!  Who is this?
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
Quiet!
It's about this.
IRA - instant retirement account.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Diamonds all over.
Very well, Jacques.
Where did you find it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
Amsterdam?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, Baron.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Um-hum!
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
M'sieu ...
Now just a minute, Major--
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
No--proud. Very proud!
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Gaston Monescu.
Seven and nine!
Ah!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
He recognized you!
Yes.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
Oh! You didn't read it!
M'sieu Laval!
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
That sounds sensible. 
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Um-hum ...
I <u>must</u> go.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
On the night table.
Please! 
No--thirty-five! 
Call the police?
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
Well, where is it?
Hurry, Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Don't you mean work me?
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I was tired.
What do I tell your mother?
Can I bum a cigarette?
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
No.
You're crazy.
Well, here you are.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
No, no! Just with her hands.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
He does landscapes.
To the stars.
It's okay. I'm alright.
I'll be right back.
It's so cold.
I promise.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Will you leave me alone?
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
I don't understand.
Isn't that interesting?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Guess again, copper.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Sure!  Excuse me.
Yes--
Good-by!
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
At seven-thirty?
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
What do you know about them?
You can live that down, can't you?
Make it five.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Change?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
I'll go with you--
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Sure, I'll go.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Why, I--
Thanks. That makes us square.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
I should say not.
She did?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Back is in New York.
Sure.
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Do what--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Meaning what?
Somebody's got to do it--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
I'm getting seasick--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
What's he got that I haven't got?
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Not a chance--I'm through. 
Thank you.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Sure, Sis.
Hey--you! Where you going?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Not now.  I don't have time.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I was kidding about that.
Enough?  Never.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Sorry...
Not half as bad as I feel.
I don't.
What?  But I saw 'em-
Awful lot of money.
What was that all about?
Colorado's closer
How is he?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
No really, I can stay a while.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
You wanted to talk?
So he can tell the story.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
That didn't sound like thunder.
You're on.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
I know, I need a keeper.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
Yeah, and dangerous.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
...Words to live by?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
- We all want what we can't have?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Who knows? Fog, night...
That's reassuring.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Happily.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
I hope so.
What?
What do you mean?
Up.
Next time, I do the driving.
Of course.
I understand.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Sabotage?
I am. What do you want?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Excellent.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
Fueled and waiting.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Now how far would further out be?
Go back to sleep.
You all act like two roosters.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
What happened to your hand?
It's healing now.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
Tolerable well.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
What's a toby?
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Don't shout!
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Oh, yeah!
But Mom, I can't find him!
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
But what if we leave them behind?
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Mm-hmmmmm.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Go away.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Everyone, it's Woody!
I got dibs on his hat!
Heh-heh.
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Murderer!
Did I get my package in the mail?
She's sick!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Nothing.
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Sir!  No Sir!

What?!
Got it.
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Slink!  Hang on!
She got away.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Is that all?
Finn -
I've got a present for you...
Storms?
I don't know what you mean.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
I was just waiting for the right time.
Why?
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Caroline --
What do you think?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Sixteen
Yes.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Have you done your homework, honey?
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Depends on the state.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
We're playing!
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
So you pay off our customs officials?
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Who?
We agree.
I feel like a traitor.
An informant.
If I can.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I don't know what to say.
No. On you go.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Thanks.
Shut up.
Unless you get caught.
Eh? How's that?
Now?
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Cheers.
Right.
Another dab?
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
So who else?
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
We're two thousand short.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Your usual table, sir?
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Such as?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
He doubts me.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Plotting our new course.
Pavel.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Oh, please.
Have the Klingons responded?
Understood. Kirk out.
It's all I have.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
MM.?
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Goodnight, Bones.
What do you mean?
Damn.  Let's go.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
Yes, Captain.
Captain, what have I done -
If you think it would help.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
I did not.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
"c."... "k."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Not possible. You were never alone.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...


"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
No. You must kill me.
I hide no pain.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
I know, I met him.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Right on the money!
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Tron...?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Recognizers!
We have to talk.
Strategic Air Command.
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
It's something Users do.
Okay, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
You're kidding.
In the helicopter.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
In her dreams.
The purse is still at the house.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes sir.
Yes, sir.
I'd like that.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Yes what?
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
What'd you do, honey?
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Sure, hon.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Yes.
Dance?
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Those idiots.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
We're going to Paris?
His wife.
Nope.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
What time is it?
What do you do?
Where are you from.
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Uh-huh.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
You will?
Thank you.
You don't know him -
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
How come?
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Take that shit somewhere else.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
No thanks.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Ask him if he got the letter.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Every word of it.
I certainly hope so.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
Really?
How 'bout me what?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
He trusts you?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
No. No you're not.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
I bullshitted him.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
She seems very nice.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
Do you still have friends on the force?
Do tell. Why drug related?
No.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
McTeague.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
How the fuck could he know?
Rock whores.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Where's that?
Uh, what?
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
Shut up!
What are you going to do with us?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I need to go.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
What year is it?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
I don't know -- I don't remember.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
It's private.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
Hey, man...
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
You can't do that yourself?
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, yeah.
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
Hundred and eight already.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It will.
I need a ticket.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
I don't care, just get me there.
How much.
One way.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You Harlin?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Twenty-after-ten.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You believe that?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
What's it to you?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
Yeah, I'll try.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
I think I burned my gun hand!
John . . .
Who the hell is this!?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
What does it look like?
I don't know your real name.
You sure you can manage?
No trouble at all, really.
You're welcome, Grace.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Games?
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Whatever it takes.
Yeah.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
You live pretty good.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
What was I supposed to do?
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
He was going to--
You could give me the gun.
Now what?
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Just ran into a little trouble.
You're talking like a mad man.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
How do you put a price on murder?
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
All I have in the world.
Darrell giving you problems?
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
You're not talking sense.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I said come on!
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Stand up.
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
But, Senor--
You can't do that yourself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Who's cursed?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
I do.
You're talking like a madman.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
You came to take my wife from me?
What are you talking about!
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
So?
Darrell--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
What?
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Do you have to call me that?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Thank you.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
What?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
How do you know he's still not here?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
No.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
No! You get it!
What are you talking about?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Wrong number.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
There's someone in the house.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I said come on!
I want my lawyer!
Wow.
What did I say?
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
Rust?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
I don't know Megan.
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
We've already begun.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Just one--
I'll help you.
How much can you lift?
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
You're lying.
Is that right?
Okay.
Against a window.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
And what was that explanation?
What wife? He don't have no wife.
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Your wife?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
She back in Kansas?
Shit and fried eggs.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Uh... Duke.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
What business?
Well... I don't recollect.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
Shut up, Kid.
Yup.
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
Yeah.
Two weeks, I guess.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
How far kin you see?
Yeah... you said that last night.
He's dead, Bill.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Two.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Did I what?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Yeah?
Plenty of times.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
We'll bury him.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Yeah?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
A glass of water would be nice.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
You okay?
Well, I'm sorry.
Maybe more.
Not if we do it my way.
This I had to see myself.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Neither do we.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Business or personal?
Who is he?
Which is shit.
What?
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I'm not a rat.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
Kobayashi.
Wait a minute.
Why lie about everything else, then?
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Very good.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
How did you settle on the amount?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
I was her doctor.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
...We did everything we could...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
No.
I'm on the staff of...
Nothing further, your Honor.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
... that's all right.
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
The Doctors were not negligent.
That's what I'd planned to...
...I made a reservation at...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Yes...I...yes.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
I understand.
No.
I've got nothing to say to you.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Thank you for seeing me.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
What?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Mr. Concannon...?
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
How come you're calling me from...?
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Still looking.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
I've got to work.
I...
If I don't 'grow up...'
It's over!
No...no...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
What?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
No.
Right.
...one of the other nurses?
We got to talk.
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
In New York?
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
Huh.  And why is that?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No, I'm all right.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
And when she goes to those places...
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
Do you live here in the hotel?
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Why?
Why?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Okay.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Take me away...
You can't. You're afraid!
Some money.
I loved you, Madeleine.
Where had you been before?
You like it, too.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Not at all, I enjoyed --
No! No, thank you!
We have.
Good-bye.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
No birds live here.
No, thank you.
Madeleine!
The tall trees...
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
No.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
Why? What's happened?
Only this far.
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Yes.
Please answer my question.
Carlotta Valdes?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Would you please go and look?
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
What a pleasant hobby.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
That!?!
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Do you know him well?
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Oh?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What is it, a still life?
Excellent.
The hell you do.
You fucking bastard!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
What are you talking about?
Just giving the facts.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
I am not flexible on this.
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Adam! Calm down.
They won't figure it out.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
Later.
No. I think it's fucked.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I know...
What happened? Oh my God...
It has to be done.
I don't think so.
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Where is she?
Sweet deal.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Here's his head.
Nobody knows.
I'm talking about prayer.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
What did you ask me?
What you just said. Say it again.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
What does that mean?
Yeah.
Hear what?
The hell you didn't!
Moore?
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
Not really, no.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
How could I know what else I forgot?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's quiet.
Why? What's his problem?
It's vile!
Problems?
So what do we do?
I'll call them from the road.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I will.
Well I do.
I'm mad at you.
Can we just talk this out?
We're not canceling.
Yeah. You.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
But...
What does that mean?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
I love you dad.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
What does that mean?
Go for it.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
What is it?
Yup.
That's what I'm thinking.
Okay great. What will that be?
What song?
I do.
That's right.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
No.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How could anybody behave like that?
Evil.
Wasn't that cowardice?
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
That's it.
And in the vegetable plot?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Where's the dough?
Why?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Stop this!
Why not?
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
This louse is looking for trouble.
Yes!
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I had so many things to think about!
When you are, miss.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
But only you will know he's not human.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
He was a computer program for crissake.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
You think he's smart?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reÂassignment.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I'm still making adjustments...
I'M WHAT?!
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
This is supposed to be years away.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
It was me, what?
Of course you are.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
That's not true, Parker.
It wasn't a lie.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I've been in prison, remember?
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
How did you get your hand out?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Nothing.
Enjoying yourself?
Start of what?
Both.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Sid?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
My...secret.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.

Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."

Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."

"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.

S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Might, if I was asked... 
Of what?
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
...givem what they want...But...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Get on your feet, boy.
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...

He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
They look stupid.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
...they... <u>you</u> know...
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Start unloading.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
How's Mom?
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
I met them before you were born.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
What are you doing here?
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
What'd you tell him?
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
We are?
So you're hot on this stock?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Jackson, Steinem...
What? How do you know about my father?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What makes you think you can?
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Obviously...
Gordon.
Yeah, almost...
Well, why stop at that?
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Get the hell out!
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
So why are you dating Jonathan?
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Ok toots, I will.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Jenkins!
A party at a waxwork huh?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
China
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Right behind you.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Sell my soul?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Hey.
So much.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Then why did you?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Yes, but...
What do you think?  Guess.
You were in an accident?
I am.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
Um...
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
I don't know.
Um...yes.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
I've never even met you.
And then you weren't there.
Very much.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Um...sure.
She never mentioned her father.
Of course.
I came in from my room...
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Good.  I'm good.
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
M-E...
I think so
What are you going to do?
If she was dangerous before--
Did he say that?
I think three...
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
Don't.
Three o'clock.
You are...
We did.
Yup.
Mmm.
You're kidding.
Well, that's nice.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What's going on, Claire?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
We had a seance.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Yep.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
I felt you...looking through me...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Not personally.
Yes.  The ghost.
STOP IT!
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
STOP IT!
What?
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
Shhhh.
MADISON!
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Hello...?  Who is this...?
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
I had you sent away.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
'He'...?
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
The door, Michael.  find the key...
He just went out like & light-
Lie...?
If you knew how I yearn for that...
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I bring her flowers too.
I love Michael...
Leave me alone!
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?

What about you coming down here...?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Dropped it.
That's not funny.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
I don't know.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
The one on the left - definitely...
I'm sorry - I didn't think
BRIAN...
That's right...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Sure...
The touch?
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
I think I will pass...
I'm a dentist
Where do you kill them...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Out - I may be some time
You killed my friend!
No - I'll have you after
At 2.00...
Yes I can...
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
At home alone - where were you?
Don't worry about it -
Yes...?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Yes - one please.
Were you always this sick?
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Well, Dad said...
Yeah, whatever.
Dead?
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Let me get this straight...
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Yeah?
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
I guess.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
...not the pit.
Just say it, Dad.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Got it.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
That's me.
Hmmm?
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Eventually you'll let go.
I'm trembling with excitement.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
That's refreshingly deviant.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
That's hard to believe.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
He was in a league of his own.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
People pay good money for that?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
I understand.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
Lombardo's settlement?
Unless what?
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
You could say that.
You have someplace to be?
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
What about witnesses?
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
I'm sorry?
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
What?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Lombardo ever come out here?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
What brain?
I think we just need to get wasted.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
You're out of your mind.
You notice my new jumper?
Yes.  God, Mom...
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
That's right.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
You got something against cigarettes?
Story's the same, Detective...
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Put Kelly on too.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Jim West.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Prepare what?
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
We'll see.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
I don't like to lose, either.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Yes sir.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
It is?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Me?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
No.  I mean yes.
You're not a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I don't believe you.
He's no magician.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Friend of yours?
I hate this.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Because she's sick.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Absolutely not.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
What do I need for that?
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Somebody has to do it.
I changed her already!
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Sorry. It's important.
They're Amish.
I thought I was the English.
Yes, sir.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
I can't.
No, no doctor...
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
But you can't.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Hochmut?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
I'm going this morning.
A real fireball.
But... You may not be well enough.
I know.
I hear you.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch Â I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
No...
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
If any!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Oh ....
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Uh-huh.
Has it poppies on the wall....
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Did you say something?
My mouth -- my mouth!
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Oh --
Oh --
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Ohhh!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
I have so got brains.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
It's pleasant down that way, too.
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Who at?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Now...
This way!  Come on!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Hold still - hold still --
Not nohow!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
To Oz!
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Hurry -- hurry --
Yes.
It's a whozis?
Well, that's you all over.
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
If I donÂt get to the Boa before he gets to MaidenÂs Tower, M is dead.
We canÂt.
So isnÂt it time you unwrapped your present?
SheÂs not a girl anymore.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Renard.
Who did you get it from?
I canÂt tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
ItÂs I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
IÂm sorry.
ItÂs not the pin your father wore. ItÂs an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
No.
...you should rest.
Really?
I think you do.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
You turned Renard.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familyÂs!
Bond, IÂm a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familyÂs, now itÂs mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
SheÂs no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnÂt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
How appropriate.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Wrong answers?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Jon, no -- I can't --
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Cured, yes.
Jon -- what??
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
What is it?  How does it work?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.

Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
What are you up to?
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
I think he's going to the john.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
With lots of ketchup?
Janey, will you marry me?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Ever see one of these before?
What is that ungodly smell?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
We're not after car thieves here.
Yes it does.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
That's exactly why we need them.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What weapons do you have?
What do you get if you finish?
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Yorgi asked me to.
Go to hell.
Mind your business.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
We hung out last night, remember?
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
That's would be me.
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Is this what you're looking for?
Been to any good diners lately?
When else are you gonna do it?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Of course.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
... until he found tungsten.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Its core?
What's that?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
By reading my thoughts?
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
He takes his work seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
Deal.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
A piece.  Only a piece.
ALIVE.
What do you want with him?
It does indeed, Max.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Oh, nice.
You're incorrigible!
Darling!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Break that old man's violin.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I beg your pardon?
Why are you talking like that?
Wockers with the knockers???
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
All right... elevate me!
Tonight?
What?
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Act casual!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
... It's.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
What a filthy mess.
Yes!
Raise the platform, hurry!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Good night!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
I see what you mean.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Four
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Thank you.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
